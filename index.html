What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i>. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.</p><br><p> This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the <i>New York Times</i>, tthe <i>American Economic Review</i>, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.</p></p><p><b>John von Neumann</b> (1903-1957) was one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century and a pioneering figure in computer science. A native of Hungary who held professorships in Germany, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in 1933. Later he worked on the Manhattan Project, helped develop the IAS computer, and was a consultant to IBM. An important influence on many fields of mathematics, he is the author of <i>Functional Operators, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</i>, and <i>Continuous Geometry</i> (all Princeton). <b>Oskar Morgenstern</b> (1902-1977) taught at the University of Vienna and directed the Austrian Institute of Business Cycle Research before settling in the United States in 1938. There he joined the faculty of Princeton University, eventually becoming a professor and from 1948 directing its econometric research program. He advised the United States government on a wide variety of subjects. Though most famous for the book he co-authored with von Neumann, Morgenstern was also widely known for his skepticism about economic measurement, as reflected in one of his many other books, <i>On the Accuracy of Economic Observations</i> (Princeton). <b>Harold Kuhn</b> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Economics at Princeton University. <b>Ariel Rubinstein</b> is Professor of Economics at Tel Aviv University and at New York University."One cannot but admire the audacity of vision, the perseverance in details, and the depth of thought displayed in almost every page of the book. . . . The appearance of a book of [this] calibre . . . is indeed a rare event." (<i>The American Economic Review</i>)<br><br>"Posterity may regard this book as one of the major scientific achievements of the first half of the twentieth century. This will undoubtedly be the case if the authors have succeeded in establishing a new exact science--the science of economics. The foundation which they have laid is extremely promising." (<i>The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i>)<br><br>"Praise for Princeton's previous edition: "Opinions still vary on the success of the project to put economics on a sound mathematical footing, but game theory was eventually hugely influential, especially on mathematics and the study of automata. Every self-respecting library must have one.""<b>---Mike Holderness, <i>New Scientist</i></b><br><br>"While the jury is still out on the success or failure of game theory as an attempted palace coup within the economics community, few would deny that interest in the subject--as measured in numbers of journal page--is at or near an all-time high. For that reason alone, this handsome new edition of von Neumann and Morgenstern's still controversial classic should be welcomed by the entire research community."<b>---James Case, <i>SIAM News</i></b><br><br>"The main achievement of the book lies, more than in its concrete results, in its having introduced into economics the tools of modern logic and in using them with an astounding power of generalization." (<i>The Journal of Political Economy</i>)<br><br>"Praise for Princeton's previous edition: "A rich and multifaceted work. . . . [S]ixty years later, the <i>Theory of Games</i> may indeed be viewed as one of the landmarks of twentieth-century social science.""<b>---Robert J.

Even today, some 2000 years later, we have his own words and are able to learn from his wisdom. May you be blessed as you read this book.

Neither of the two dominant models (disease or choice) adequately accounts for the experience of those who are addicted or of those who are seeking to help them. In this interdisciplinary work, Kent Dunnington brings the neglected resources of philosophical and theological analysis to bear on the problem of addiction. Drawing on the insights of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, he formulates an alternative to the usual reductionistic models. Going further, Dunnington maintains that addiction is not just a problem facing individuals. Its pervasiveness sheds prophetic light on our cultural moment. Moving beyond issues of individual treatment, this groundbreaking study also outlines significant implications for ministry within the local church context.</p><p><strong>Kent Dunnington</strong> is assistant professor of philosophy, Greenville College. He holds the Ph.D. in philosophy from Texas AM, and the M.T.S. in theology from Duke University."This would be a good read for those of you who want to explore more deeply the true nature of addiction, are unhappy with the disease or choice models as explanations, and, in the face of the limiations of the recovery movement, want to be encouraged by the veritable contributions of Christianity." (Linda S. Parker, Dharma Deepika, July-December 2012)<br><br>"<em>Addiction and Virtue</em> sets the stage for a new scene in the church, where she is no longer dulled and distracted by a secular vision of happiness, but is a vibrant, attractive, and welcoming community of 'repentant sinners.'" (Paul Warhurst, Themelios 37.1)<br><br>"Dunnington's work neither demonizes the addicted person nor excuses the abuse of alcohol and drugs. But it points the way toward compassion for the individual, transformation of the culture (including the church), and recovery through the fullness of the Christian gospel." (Amy Julia Becker, Christianity Today, September 2011)<br><br>"An intelligent, informed and well-integrated treatment of virtue and addiction that doesn't fall into theological, philosophical or scientific dogma. Dunnington provides a framework that is invaluable for clinicians and researchers in the area of addiction, and for those who strive to live the virtuous life." (William M. Struthers, associate professor of psychology, Wheaton College, and author of Wired for Intimacy)<br><br>"Kent Dunnington offers a compelling account of addiction as interpreted through the lens of virtue. A strong theological and philosophical foundation helps the reader to see how the good news of Jesus Christ offers a powerful alternative to the habit of addiction. While some within the addiction treatment community will find Dunnington's arguments controversial, others will experience them as a breath of fresh air. Either way, <em>Addiction and Virtue</em> is a worthwhile read!" (Virginia T. Holeman, professor of counseling, Asbury Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In <em>Addiction and Virtue</em> Kent Dunnington uses Aristotle, Thomas and the philosophically clarified concept of <em>habit</em> to illuminate addiction. The addicts in our midst emerge as 'contemporary prophets' who, if we can but find the ears to hear them, call society as a whole to profound change and the Christian church in particular to renewal. This valuable book points the way, if we are ever to recover from all our junkie-like 'habits' of personal behavior and social interaction, to turn them into truly sustaining habitats for flourishing human life." (Francis F. Seeburger, professor of philosophy, University of Denver)<br><br>"<em>Addiction and Virtue</em> is one of only a few books which use philosophy to unpack the false dilemma limiting addiction to either disease or willful choice. What's more, Dunnington does this from a Christian theological perspective." (Linda Mercadante, author, Victims Sinners, and professor, The Methodist Theological School in Ohio)<br><br>"Considerations of addiction as disease are helpful but inadequate. Kent Dunnington shows us that addiction is a habit, more akin to idolatry or wrongful worship. In doing so he deepens our notions of addiction, but also enriches our understandings of sin and redemption. I can't think of a more timely subject, or a more exemplary way to do theological ethics." (Sam Wells, dean of the chapel, Duke University)<br><br>"Drawing on Aristotle's and Aquinas's accounts of habit, Kent Dunnington has given us an analysis of addiction we have desperately needed. Few are able to combine philosophical analysis with theological insight, but Dunnington has done it in a manner that helps us better understand the nature of addiction and why it is so prevalent in our time. This is a book that needs to be read, not only by those who work in the fields of addictive behaviors but also by philosophers, theologians and pastors. I suspect in a short amount of time, this book will be viewed as something of a classic in the field."

But deep in the forest on his father&#x2019;s farm two gnomes called Pine Cone and Pepper Pot are worried. What if the school does not teach Tom his letters properly? What if the teacher messes the alphabet up? Then Tom might spell Pine Cone as NEPI NOEC, or Pepper Pot as PREPREP TOP. He might even spell the famous Tiptoes Lightly as TOESPIT THIGLLY. That would be a disaster. A huge disaster! So the two gnomes, with the help of Tiptoes Lightly and Farmer John, set out to teach Tom his letters. Tom&#x2019;s younger sister, June Berry, insists on being taught too, and never will they, or anyone else who reads this tale, forget their ABC&#x2019;s &#x2013; or their LMNOP&#x2019;s or QRST&#x2019;s either.</p> <p>Whether your child knows their alphabet or not Pine Cone and Pepper Pot guarantee that they will see the letters and their shapes with new and creative eyes. <i>The Alphabet</i> is filled with stories, songs, pictures, plays and adventures silly and bold.</p> <p><i>The Alphabet</i> is a large format, full color book, suitable for children from late kindergarten to grade three - and for teachers or homeschoolers seeking to enrich the art of learning to write.</p> <p>PS - the humorous use of the word 'learned' instead of 'taught' in the subtitle, while colloquial, is correct.

At first it was a few scattered grains taken from the base of an alluvial fan where millions of tons of sand and silt had washed down from a chain of rugged peaks; yet the gold was ragged under the magnifying glass.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gold that has carried any distance becomes worn and polished by the abrasive action of the accompanying rocks and sand, so this could not have been carried far. With caution born of harsh experience he seated himself and lighted his pipe, yet excitement was strong within him.<br> &nbsp;<br> A contemplative man by nature, experience had taught him how a man may be deluded by hope, yet all his instincts told him the source of the gold was somewhere on the mountain above. It could have come down the wash that skirted the base of the mountain, but the ragged condition of the gold made that improbable.<br> &nbsp;<br> The base of the fan was a half-mile across and hundreds of feet thick, built of silt and sand washed down by centuries of erosion among the higher peaks. The point of the wide V of the fan lay between two towering upthrusts of granite, but from where Wetherton sat he could see that the actual source of the fan lay much higher.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wetherton made camp near a tiny spring west of the fan, then picketed his burros and began his climb. When he was well over two thousand feet higher he stopped, resting again, and while resting he dry-panned some of the silt. Surprisingly, there were more than a few grains of gold even in that first pan, so he continued his climb, and passed at last between the towering portals of the granite columns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Above this natural gate were three smaller alluvial fans that joined at the gate to pour into the greater fan below. Dry-panning two of these brought no results, but the third, even by the relatively poor method of dry-panning, showed a dozen colors, all of good size.<br> &nbsp;<br> The head of this fan lay in a gigantic crack in a granitic upthrust that resembled a fantastic ruin. Pausing to catch his breath, his gaze wandered along the base of this upthrust, and right before him the crumbling granite was slashed with a vein of quartz that was literally laced with gold!<br> &nbsp;<br> Struggling nearer through the loose sand, his heart pounding more from excitement than from altitude and exertion, he came to an abrupt stop. The band of quartz was six feet wide and that six feet was cobwebbed with gold.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was unbelievable, but here it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet even in this moment of success, something about the beetling cliff stopped him from going forward. His innate caution took hold and he drew back to examine it at greater length. Wary of what he saw, he circled the batholith and then climbed to the ridge behind it from which he could look down upon the roof. What he saw from there left him dry-mouthed and jittery.<br> &nbsp;<br> The granitic upthrust was obviously a part of a much older range, one that had weathered and worn, suffered from shock and twisting until finally this tower of granite had been violently upthrust, leaving it standing, a shaky ruin among younger and sturdier peaks. In the process the rock had been shattered and riven by mighty forces until it had become a miner&#x2019;s horror. Wetherton stared, fascinated by the prospect. With enormous wealth here for the taking, every ounce must be taken at the risk of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> One stick of powder might bring the whole crumbling mass down in a heap, and it loomed all of three hundred feet above its base in the fan. The roof of the batholith was riven with gigantic cracks, literally seamed with breaks like the wall of an ancient building that has remained standing after heavy bombing. Walking back to the base of the tower, Wetherton found he could actually break loose chunks of the quartz with his fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The vein itself lay on the downhill side and at the very base. The outer wall of the upthrust was sharply tilted so that a man working at the vein would be cutting his way into the very foundations of the tower, and any single blow of the pick might bring the whole mass down upon him. Furthermore, if the rock did fall, the vein would be hopelessly buried under thousands of tons of rock and lost without the expenditure of much more capital than he could command. And at this moment Wetherton&#x2019;s total of money in hand amounted to slightly less than forty dollars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thirty yards from the face he seated himself upon the sand and filled his pipe once more. A man might take tons out of there without trouble, and yet it might collapse at the first blow. Yet he knew he had no choice. He needed money and it lay here before him. Even if he were at first successful there were two things he must avoid. The first was tolerance of danger that might bring carelessness; the second, that urge to go back for that &#x201c;little bit more&#x201d; that could kill him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> IT WAS WELL into the afternoon and he had not eaten, yet he was not hungry. He circled the batholith, studying it from every angle only to reach the conclusion that his first estimate had been correct. The only way to get at the gold was to go into the very shadow of the leaning wall and attack it at its base, digging it out by main strength. From where he stood it seemed ridiculous that a mere man with a pick could topple that mass of rock, yet he knew how delicate such a balance could be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tower was situated on what might be described as the military crest of the ridge, and the alluvial fan sloped steeply away from its lower side, steeper than a steep stairway. The top of the leaning wall overshadowed the top of the fan, and if it started to crumble and a man had warning, he might run to the north with a bare chance of escape. The soft sand in which he must run would be an impediment, but that could be alleviated by making a walk from flat rocks sunken into the sand.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was dusk when he returned to his camp. Deliberately, he had not permitted himself to begin work, not by so much as a sample. He must be deliberate in all his actions, and never for a second should he forget the mass that towered above him. A split second of hesitation when the crash came&#x2014;and he accepted it as inevitable&#x2014;would mean burial under tons of crumbled rock.<br> &nbsp;<br> The following morning he picketed his burros on a small meadow near the spring, cleaned the spring itself and prepared a lunch. Then he removed his shirt, drew on a pair of gloves and walked to the face of the cliff. Yet even then he did not begin, knowing that upon this habit of care and deliberation might depend not only his success in the venture, but life itself. He gathered flat stones and began building his walk. &#x201c;When you start moving,&#x201d; he told himself, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll have to be fast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Recipes for Your Perfectly Imperfect Life: Everyday Ways to Live and Eat for Health, Healing, and Happiness</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Beauty Detox series, nutritionist, and personal development expert Kimberly Snyder offers us a powerful new guide to help us feel good, eat well, dispel insecurities, and increase our love of life.</b><br><br>Feeling good is <i>not </i>about having a picture-perfect life with a flawless body, job, and family.

He destroys the perverse logic of the Do-Gooders who want to help one group or another because, somehow, it&#39;s the fair thing to do. Bastiat shows that the result of all this protection and benevolence is to make people poorer and less free. His lessons and logic are up to date and powerful. Amazingly, the book originally came out in 1850! The Law is a quick read for both the beginner and the neophyte... and one you&#39;ll choose to re-read.</p><p>Frederick Bastiat was a French Philosopher &amp; Political Economist of the mid-1800s, who was influenced by such market oriented thinkers as Adam Smith. His background in business, academia, and politics provided a unique perspective on what really works to improve the human condition - and to him, it wasn't more government.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Unbroken (Movie Tie-in Edition): A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � The incredible true story of survival and salvation that is the basis for two major motion pictures: 2014&#x2019;s <i>Unbroken </i>and the upcoming <i>Unbroken: Path to Redemption</i>.</b><br><br>On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane&#x2019;s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.<br><br>The lieutenant&#x2019;s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he&#x2019;d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.<br><br>Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater.

There was a sound coming from outside, growing ever louder. It was a huge, heavy rush, suggesting immensity, a great parting of air. It was coming from directly above the house. The boy swung his legs off his bed, raced down the stairs, slapped open the back door, and loped onto the grass. The yard was otherworldly, smothered in unnatural darkness, shivering with sound. The boy stood on the lawn beside his older brother, head thrown back, spellbound. <br><br>The sky had disappeared. An object that he could see only in silhouette, reaching across a massive arc of space, was suspended low in theair over the house. It was longer than two and a half football fields and as tall as a city. It was putting out the stars. <br><br>What he saw was the German dirigible Graf Zeppelin. At nearly 800 feet long and 110 feet high, it was the largest flying machine evercrafted. More luxurious than the finest airplane, gliding effortlessly over huge distances, built on a scale that left spectators gasping, it was, in the summer of '29, the wonder of the world. <br><br>The airship was three days from completing a sensational feat of aeronautics, circumnavigation of the globe. The journey had begun onAugust 7, when the Zeppelin had slipped its tethers in Lakehurst, New Jersey, lifted up with a long, slow sigh, and headed for Manhattan. On Fifth Avenue that summer, demolition was soon to begin on the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, clearing the way for a skyscraper of unprecedented proportions, the Empire State Building. At Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx, players were debuting numbered uniforms: Lou Gehrig wore No. 4; Babe Ruth, about to hit his five hundredth home run, wore No. 3. On Wall Street, stock prices were racing toward an all-time high. <br><br>After a slow glide around the Statue of Liberty, the Zeppelin banked north, then turned out over the Atlantic. In time, land came below again: France, Switzerland, Germany. The ship passed over Nuremberg, where fringe politician Adolf Hitler, whose Nazi Party had been trounced in the 1928 elections, had just delivered a speech touting selective infanticide. Then it flew east of Frankfurt, where a Jewish woman named Edith Frank was caring for her newborn, a girl named Anne. Sailing northeast, the Zeppelin crossed over Russia. Siberian villagers, so isolated that they'd never even seen a train, fell to their knees at the sight of it. <br><br>On August 19, as some four million Japanese waved handkerchiefs and shouted "Banzai!" the Zeppelin circled Tokyo and sank onto a landing field. Four days later, as the German and Japanese anthems played, the ship rose into the grasp of a typhoon that whisked it over the Pacific at breathtaking speed, toward America. Passengers gazing from the windows saw only the ship's shadow, following it along the clouds "like a huge shark swimming alongside." When the clouds parted, the passengers glimpsed giant creatures, turning in the sea, that looked like monsters. <br><br>On August 25, the Zeppelin reached San Francisco. After being cheered down the California coast, it slid through sunset, into darkness and silence, and across midnight. As slow as the drifting wind, it passed over Torrance, where its only audience was a scattering of drowsy souls, among them the boy in his pajamas behind the house on Gramercy Avenue. <br><br>Standing under the airship, his feet bare in the grass, he was transfixed. It was, he would say, "fearfully beautiful." He could feel the rumble of the craft's engines tilling the air but couldn't make out the silver skin, the sweeping ribs, the finned tail. He could see only the blackness of the space it inhabited. It was not a great presence but a great absence, a geometric ocean of darkness that seemed to swallow heaven itself. <br><br>The boy's name was Louis Silvie Zamperini. The son of Italian immigrants, he had come into the world in Olean, New York, on January 26, 1917, eleven and a half pounds of baby under black hair as coarse as barbed wire. His father, Anthony, had been living on his own since age fourteen, first as a coal miner and boxer, then as a construction worker. His mother, Louise, was a petite, playful beauty, sixteen at marriage and eighteen when Louie was born. In their apartment, where only Italian was spoken, Louise and Anthony called their boy Toots. <br><br>From the moment he could walk, Louie couldn't bear to be corralled. His siblings would recall him careening about, hurdling flora, fauna, and furniture. The instant Louise thumped him into a chair and told him to be still, he vanished. If she didn't have her squirming boy clutched in her hands, she usually had no idea where he was. <br><br>In 1919, when two-year-old Louie was down with pneumonia, he climbed out his bedroom window, descended one story, and went on a naked tear down the street with a policeman chasing him and a crowd watching in amazement. Soon after, on a pediatrician's advice, Louise and Anthony decided to move their children to the warmer climes of California. Sometime after their train pulled out of Grand Central Station, Louie bolted, ran the length of the train, and leapt from the caboose. Standing with his frantic mother as the train rolled backward in search of the lost boy, Louie's older brother, Pete, spotted Louie strolling up the track in perfect serenity. Swept up in his mother's arms, Louie smiled. "I knew you'd come back," he said in Italian. <br><br>In California, Anthony landed a job as a railway electrician and bought a half-acre field on the edge of Torrance, population 1,800. He and Louise hammered up a one-room shack with no running water, an outhouse behind, and a roof that leaked so badly that they had to keep buckets on the beds. With only hook latches for locks, Louise took to sitting by the front door on an apple box with a rolling pin in her hand, ready to brain any prowlers who might threaten her children. <br><br>There, and at the Gramercy Avenue house where they settled a year later, Louise kept prowlers out, but couldn't keep Louie in hand. Contesting a footrace across a busy highway, he just missed getting broadsided by a jalopy. At five, he started smoking, picking up discarded cigarette butts while walking to kindergarten. He began drinking one night when he was eight; he hid under the dinner table, snatched glasses of wine, drank them all dry, staggered outside, and fell into a rosebush. <br><br>On one day, Louise discovered that Louie had impaled his leg on a bamboo beam; on another, she had to ask a neighbor to sew Louie's severed toe back on. When Louie came home drenched in oil after scaling an oil rig, diving into a sump well, and nearly drowning, it took a gallon of turpentine and a lot of scrubbing before Anthony recognized his son again. Thrilled by the crashing of boundaries, Louie was untamable. As he grew into his uncommonly clever mind, mere feats of daring were no longer satisfying. In Torrance, a one-boy insurgency was born. <br><br>If it was edible, Louie stole it. He skulked down alleys, a roll of lock-picking wire in his pocket. Housewives who stepped from their kitchens would return to find that their suppers had disappeared. Residents looking out their back windows might catch a glimpse of a long-legged boy dashing down the alley, a whole cake balanced on his hands. When a local family left Louie off their dinner-party guest list, he broke into their house, bribed their Great Dane with a bone, and cleaned out their icebox. At another party,he absconded with an entire keg of beer. When he discovered that the cooling tables at Meinzer's Bakery stood within an arm's length of the back door, he began picking the lock, snatching pies, eating until he was full, and reserving the rest as ammunition for ambushes. When rival thieves took up the racket, he suspended the stealing until the culprits were caught and the bakery owners dropped their guard. Then he ordered his friends to rob Meinzer's again.<br><br>It is a testament to the content of Louie's childhood that his stories about it usually ended with "...and then I ran like mad." He was often chased by people he had robbed, and at least two people threatened to shoot him. To minimize the evidence found on him when the police habitually came his way, he set up loot-stashing sites around town, including a three-seater cave that he dug in a nearby forest. Under the Torrance High bleachers, Pete once found a stolen wine jug that Louie had hidden there. It was teeming with inebriated ants. In the lobby of the Torrance theater, Louie stopped up the pay telephone's coin slots with toilet paper. He returned regularly to feedwire behind the coins stacked up inside, hook the paper, and fill his palms with change. A metal dealer never guessed that the grinning Italian kid who often came by to sell him armfuls of copper scrap had stolen the same scrap from his lot the night before. Discovering, while scuffling with an enemy at a circus, that adults would give quarters to fighting kids to pacify them, Louie declared a truce with the enemy and they cruised around staging brawls before strangers. <br><br>To get even with a railcar conductor who wouldn't stop for him, Louie greased the rails. When a teacher made him stand in a corner for spitballing, he deflated her car tires with toothpicks. After setting a legitimate Boy Scout state record in friction-fire ignition, he broke his record by soaking his tinder in gasoline and mixing it with match heads, causing a small explosion. He stole a neighbor's coffee percolator tube, set up a sniper's nest in a tree, crammed pepper-tree berries into his mouth, spat them through the tube, and sent the neighborhood girls running. <br><br>His magnum opus became legend. Late one night, Louie climbed the steeple of a Baptist church, rigged the bell with piano wire, strung the wire into a nearby tree, and roused the police, the fire department, and all of Torrance with apparently spontaneous pealing. The more credulous townsfolk called it a sign from God. <br><br>Only one thing scared him. When Louie was in late boyhood, a pilot landed a plane near Torrance and took Louie up for a flight. One might have expected such an intrepid child to be ecstatic, but the speed and altitude frightened him. From that day on, he wanted nothing to do with airplanes. <br><br>In a childhood of artful dodging, Louie made more than just mischief. He shaped who he would be in manhood. Confident that he was clever, resourceful, and bold enough to escape any predicament, he was almost incapable of discouragement. When history carried him into war, this resilient optimism would define him. <br><br>Louie was twenty months younger than his brother, who was everything he was not. Pete Zamperini was handsome, popular, impeccably groomed, polite to elders and avuncular to juniors, silky smooth with girls, and blessed with such sound judgment that even when he was a child, his parents consulted him on difficult decisions. He ushered his mother into her seat at dinner, turned in at seven, and tucked his alarm clock under his pillow so as not to wake Louie, with whom he shared a bed. He rose at two-thirty to run a three-hour paper route, and deposited all his earnings in the bank, which would swallow every penny when the Depression hit. He had a lovely singing voice and a gallant habit of carrying pins in his pant cuffs, in case his dance partner's dress strap failed. He once saved a girl from drowning. Pete radiated a gentle but impressive authority that led everyone he met, even adults, to be swayed by his opinion. Even Louie, who made a religion out of heeding no one, did as Pete said. <br><br>Louie idolized Pete, who watched over him and their younger sisters, Sylvia and Virginia, with paternal protectiveness. But Louie was eclipsed, and he never heard the end of it. Sylvia would recall her mother tearfully telling Louie how she wished he could be more like Pete. What made it more galling was that Pete's reputation was part myth. Though Pete earned grades little better than Louie's failing ones, his principal assumed that he was a straight-A student. On the night of Torrance's church bell miracle, a well-directed flashlight would have revealed Pete's legs dangling from the tree alongside Louie's. And Louie wasn't always the only Zamperini boy who could be seen sprinting down the alley with food that had lately belonged to the neighbors. But it never occurred to anyone to suspect Pete of anything. "Pete never got caught," said Sylvia. "Louie always got caught." <br><br>Nothing about Louie fit with other kids. He was a puny boy, and in his first years in Torrance, his lungs were still compromised enough from the pneumonia that in picnic footraces, every girl in town could dust him. His features, which would later settle into pleasant collaboration, were growing at different rates, giving him a curious face that seemed designed by committee. His ears leaned sidelong off his head like holstered pistols, and above them waved a calamity of black hair that mortified him. He attacked it with his aunt Margie's hot iron, hobbled it in a silk stocking every night, and slathered it with so much olive oil that flies trailed him to school. It did no good. <br><br>And then there was his ethnicity. In Torrance in the early 1920s, Italians were held in such disdain that when the Zamperinis arrived, the neighbors petitioned the city council to keep them out. Louie, who knew only a smattering of English until he was in grade school, couldn't hide his pedigree. He survived kindergarten by keeping mum, but in first grade, when he blurted out "Brutte bastarde!" at another kid, his teachers caught on. They compounded his misery by holding him back a grade. <br><br>He was a marked boy. Bullies, drawn by his oddity and hoping to goad him into uttering Italian curses, pelted him with rocks, taunted him, punched him, and kicked him. He tried buying their mercy with his lunch, but they pummeled him anyway, leaving him bloody. He could have ended the beatings by running away or succumbing to tears, but he refused to do either. "You could beat him to death," said Sylvia, "and he wouldn't say 'ouch' or cry." He just put his hands in front of his face and took it. As Louie neared his teens, he took a hard turn. Aloof and bristling, he lurked around the edges of Torrance, his only friendships forged loosely with rough boys who followed his lead. He became so germophobic that he wouldn't tolerate anyone coming near his food. Though he could be a sweet boy, he was often short-tempered and obstreperous. He feigned toughness, but was secretly tormented. Kids passing into parties would see him lingering outside, unable to work up the courage to walk in.</p></p><h2>Dawoud Bey on Photographing People and Communities: The Photography Workshop Series</h2><p><b>In The Photography Workshop Series, Aperture Foundation works with the world&#x2019;s top photographers to distill their creative approaches, teachings, and insights on photography&#x2015;offering the workshop experience in a book.</b> Our goal is to inspire photographers of all levels who wish to improve their work, as well as readers interested in deepening their understanding of the art of photography. <br><br><b>In this book, Dawoud Bey&#x2015;well-known for his striking portraits that reflect both the individual and their larger community&#x2015;offers his insight on creating meaningful and beautiful portraits that capture the subject and speak to something more universal.</b> Through images and words, he shares his own creative process and discusses a wide range of issues, from lighting and location to establishing relationships with subjects, and practical strategies for starting a larger portraiture project.</p><p>The work of <b>Dawoud Bey</b> is held by major collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Studio Museum in Harlem, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

Ascribed to ancient times, it was first compiled in its general form in the 12th century in Provence, compiling disparate texts which had been part of a loose and sometimes oral tradition in times prior to that same era. It contains five sections, expounding (through rabbinical scholars it is in turn ascribed to) various scriptural truths regarding the nature of the cosmos, of the deity spoken of, and explaining its way through parts of the Torah by virtue of both metaphor and scriptural comparison. The material is not entirely linear, being compiled from other sources, which may indeed have come from various dates beforehand. It interprets a slightly different story of Adam and Eve, and often dwells upon concepts which may well have been influenced in some way by Gnosticism, or by scholars who had encountered it.

We touch the mysteries of religion in a child's life, and are completely captivated by a young girl's budding lesbian identity.

She has lived in the San Francisco Bay area for the past 15 years. Her extended family and roots are New Mexican (Chicana). She works as an administrator in diversity -education and advocacy at the University of California, Berkeley. She is the editor of the anthology, <i>Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About</i>, which won a Lambda Book Award and the Out/Write Vanguard Award in 1992 and is now in its third printing. Her critical study, <i>Living Chicana Theory</i>, is in its second printing and widely used in college classrooms. <i>What Night Brings </i>is her first novel; excerpts from <i>What Night Brings </i>have already won awards from the Astraea Lesbian Writers Fund and Writers at Work.</p>*Starred Review* At one point in this compelling first novel, set in 1960s northern California, 11-year-old Marci says to her uncle, "Secrets, everyone has them, even me." First-person-narrator Marci, with her unconventional way of looking at life and uncensored mouth, is a funny, very savvy guide to her family's hidden shames. She has her own secrets (she loves girls, not boys, and she wants her father to go away--forever) and knows many of her family's--her father's infidelity, her uncle's homosexuality, her cousin Danny's drug addiction. This complex melange drives the story and lends urgency to the plot. But it is the indomitable Marci, the burr beneath her parents' skin and the author of her own salvation, who is the center of this book. <i>What Night Brings</i> is a robust addition to the growing body of Latino and Latina writing. Reminiscent of Anaya's coming-of-age novel, <i>Bless Me, Ultima</i> (1972), and Hart's memoir, <i>Barefoot Heart</i> (1999), it most strongly brings to mind Reinaldo Arenas' <i>Before Night Falls</i> (1993) in its frank portrayal of physical violence, the rawness and obscenity of the Spanish dialogue, and the awareness of Marci's budding lesbianism. Trujillo is definitely a writer to watch. <i>Ellen Loughran</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

All too often treated as a matter of compliance, student resistance can also be understood as a form of engagement, as young people confront and negotiate new identities in the classroom environment. The focus of teachers&#x2019; efforts, Toshalis says, should not be about &#x201c;managing&#x201d; adolescents but about learning how to read their behavior and respond to it in developmentally productive, culturally responsive, and democratically enriching ways.<br>&nbsp;<br>Noting that the research literature is scattered across fields, Toshalis draws on four domains of inquiry: theoretical, psychological, political, and pedagogical. The result is a resource that can help teachers address this pervasive classroom challenge in ways that enhance student agency, motivation, engagement, and academic achievement.<br>&nbsp;<br>The coauthor of<i>Understanding Youth: Adolescent Development for Educators</i> (Harvard Education Press, 2006), Toshalis blends accessible explanations of theory and research with vignettes of interactions among educators and students.

Her past was a road map to prove it. But on this particular Friday in the first week of November, she experienced one of those d�j� vu moments as the Good Lord hit Rewind on the story that was her life.</p> <p>She was sweeping the front sidewalk of Phillips' Pharmacy, where she worked, when she heard the low, sexy rumble of a hot-rod engine. The skin crawled on the back of her neck as a shiny black pickup truck went rumbling down Main Street.</p> <p>Before she could see the driver, sunlight hit the windshield, reflecting directly into her eyes. At the same time she went blind, she heard him rack the pipes on the muffler, just like Randy Joe used to do when he picked her up for their Saturday night dates. But that was a long time ago, before he went away to war in Afghanistan and got himself killed.</p> <p>She had no idea who was driving this truck, and when she looked again, it was turning the corner at the far end of the street and then it was out of sight.</p> <p>For LilyAnn, seeing that truck and hearing the pipes rattle felt like a sign. Was it the universe telling her she was living in the past? Because if it was, she already knew that. Or was it Randy Joe sending her a message, and if it was, what was he trying to say?</p> <p>As she resumed sweeping, a car drove up and parked in front of Dalton's Fitness Center next door. It was Rachel Goodhope, who ran the local bed-and-breakfast in Blessings. She got out wearing her workout clothes and waved at Lily as she ran inside.</p> <p>Lily eyed the woman's big boobs and toned body and began sweeping in earnest. Rachel looked good for a woman in her late forties, and everyone knew she liked to stay fit. She was on her third husband, and there was talk he might be getting the boot before long. No one could actually put their finger on what the problem was with Rachel and her marriages. Some said it had to do with her choice of men, while others hinted that Rachel would be a hard woman to please. Still, she obviously saw the need to stay fit in case she was ever in the market for husband number four.</p> <p>Lily was of the opinion that any woman with a backbone and the nerve to speak her mind should be difficult to please. Her great-great-grandma, Delia Bronte, had put a musket ball through a Yankee captain's hat during the War of Northern Aggression because he had not taken it off his head when he forced his way into her house. Lily liked to think she had a little bit of that in her, as well.</p> <p>Just thinking about that Yankee intruder and her great-great-grandma's gumption made her push the broom a little harder across the sidewalk. But seeing that truck had set her to thinking about the past, and before she knew it, she was knee-deep in memories long since gone.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>LilyAnn had been a constant source of pride for her parents through all her growing-up years. When she reached high school, she lost her braces and grew boobs, hitting her stride with a bang. She became an honor student, a cheerleader, and was voted prettiest and friendliest every year by her class. When she was chosen head cheerleader her senior year, Randy Joe Bentonfield, the star quarterback, also chose her for his steady girl. She was over the moon, and her parents rejoiced in the moments in which she excelled.</p> <p>As the year progressed, she marked another milestone by being named homecoming queen, then another when the announcement was made that she would be the valedictorian of her high school graduating class-two more notches in a high school career on a fast track to success.</p> <p>But it wasn't until she won the title of the Peachy-Keen Queen that her parents broke out in full braggadocio. Lily felt as if her life could not get any better. But as the old saying goes, once you've reached the top, the only place to go is downhill.</p> <p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, two planes flew into the World Trade Center in New York City and another one into the Pentagon. When the fourth one was taken down by the plane's passengers, crashing into a cornfield killing all on board, the world suddenly stopped turning on LilyAnn's axis. It was no longer about her.</p> <p>National outrage followed the shock as young men and women from all over the country began enlisting in the army, including a lot of the young men in Blessings.</p> <p>Randy Joe was one of the first to sign up. She cried herself silly, after which they made love. Randy Joe was so full of himself about being a man going away to war that he gave her a promise ring before he went away to boot camp. He came back long enough to have his picture taken in his uniform and then he shipped out, returning a month later in a flag-draped casket.</p> <p>People said it had been a good thing he'd had that picture taken beforehand because he'd come back to Blessings in pieces, no longer fit for viewing.</p> <p>His death devastated Lily, but at the same time, it thrust her back into the spotlight. Now she had a new status-the almost fianc�e of Blessings' first war casualty. She dropped out of college that year and wore black, which went really well with her long blond hair. She visited his grave site every day for a year, and people said what a faithful young woman she was, grieving for her lost love in such a fashion.</p> <p>When a new semester of college rolled around, she didn't go back. She was still paying visits to the cemetery, although as time between visits lengthened to weekly, then monthly, people still commented that LilyAnn was such a sweet thing to remember her dearly departed in such faithful ways. And because she'd lost her way and didn't know how to move past her first love or the success of her prior milestones, she took the mantle of bereavement to a whole new level.</p> <p>One year turned into two and then three, and going to college was something other people did as everything became a blur. Her daddy had a heart attack and died, which turned her mama into a widow, and Lily barely remembered her dreams for the future and had forgotten how to get there.</p> <p>The worst were the times when she could no longer bring Randy Joe's face to mind. At that point, the guilt would set her to eating a whole pint of chocolate-chip ice cream, just because it was his favorite treat. It didn't revive her memory or renew her desire to move on, but it did pack on the pounds.</p> <p>The years came and went without notice until Lily was eleven years lost. Now she only visited his grave when she thought about it and had unwittingly masked her emotions with a bulwark of extra weight.</p> <p>She had no status in Blessings beyond being one of two clerks at Phillips' Pharmacy and the daughter of Grace Bronte, the widow who married a man twelve years her junior whom she met on an online dating site and proved all her critics wrong by living happily ever after in Miami, Florida.</p> <p>Between the loss of Randy Joe and the abdication of her only living parent, LilyAnn had lost her way. She was stuck in a rut: too afraid to step out for fear of getting too close to someone and getting left behind all over again.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>At least, that's how Lily had felt, until today when the sun got in her eyes and she'd heard the rattle of those pipes. She felt off-center, like she was trying to balance on one leg, and became convinced that truck was an omen of great change.</p> <p>As soon as she finished sweeping, she went inside and began her day. Today was Friday, which meant she would get her hair done during her lunch hour. But she had to wait for Mitchell Avery, the other pharmacy clerk, and couldn't leave until he arrived.</p> <p>When Mitchell finally clocked in less than five minutes under the wire, she grabbed her jacket, turned the key to the cash register over to Mitchell, and headed out the door.</p> <p>The sun was directly overhead, and the morning breeze had quickened to a stiff wind. She shivered, wishing she had worn a heavier jacket. She caught a glimpse of herself in the plate glass windows of Dalton's Fitness Center and then quickly looked away. It was always a shock to see what she looked like now. She didn't feel like a big girl, but she was one. She quickened her step, suddenly anxious to get off the street, out of sight and judgment.</p> <p>When she reached The Curl Up and Dye, she was relieved. This was a safe place, a place where people came to get pretty. If only there was a place where people could go to get their lives back, she'd be the first standing in line.</p> <p>The bell over the door jingled as she walked inside. The owner, Ruby Dye, who everyone called Sister, was already smiling, which prompted Lily to smile back.</p> <p>"Hey, LilyAnn. How's it going, honey? Boy, that wind is sharp today, isn't it?"</p> <p>Lily nodded as she hung up her jacket. "Yes, it's getting cold. I sure hate to see winter coming."</p> <p>"I kind of like it," Ruby said. "The short days and long nights give me time to den up with a good book and some popcorn, or watch old movies on the cable channel."</p> <p>The last thing Lily needed was more time to eat through the loneliness.</p> <p>"I guess," she said, as she sat down at the shampoo station.</p> <p>As soon as Ruby put the cape around her neck, Lily leaned her head back in the sink and closed her eyes. Getting her long blond hair washed by someone else was pure luxury. When Ruby began scrubbing and massaging Lily's scalp, the tension in her shoulders began to ease. By the time they were through and she was back in the stylist chair, Lily was two shades shy of having been put into a trance.</p> <p>Ruby eyed the young woman, watching the way Lily looked everywhere but in the mirror at herself. If only there was a way to get her out of the rut she was in.</p> <p>Ruby's eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she combed some styling gel into Lily's wet hair and then reached for the blow-dryer.</p> <p>"I don't suppose you're interested in a new hairstyle?" Ruby asked.</p> <p>Lily frowned. "I wouldn't know what to do with it."</p> <p>"No matter. One of these days we'll figure something out," Ruby said.</p> <p>Her thumb was on the Power button when they all heard the sound of a hot rod passing by. Whatever the driver had done to that engine, it rumbled like a stereo with the bass set on high.</p> <p>Lily's eyes widened. It had to be the driver with the truck like Randy Joe's. She swiveled her chair around so fast to get a look that Ruby got the round brush tangled up in her hair.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. Did that pull?" Ruby asked, as she began trying to unwind it.</p> <p>Lily was oblivious. "No, no, it didn't hurt," she muttered, still craning her neck to see the driver.</p> <p>And then to everyone's surprise, the truck pulled up to the curb in front of the salon and parked, the driver racking the pipes one last time before killing the engine.</p> <p>Vesta and Vera Conklin, the twin fortysomething hairstylists, had been eating their lunch in the break room and came out to see what the noise was all about.</p> <p>Mabel Jean Doolittle was the manicurist, a little blond with a scar on her forehead from having gone through the windshield of her boyfriend's car. She called it her reminder to never date anyone that stupid again.</p> <p>She was finishing off a polish for Willa Dean Miller, who ran the local travel agency, and all the women in the shop turned to look as the driver walked in.</p> <p>He was a thirtysomething hunk in a tight, long-sleeved T-shirt tucked into a pair of fitted Wrangler jeans. He had wide shoulders, long legs, slim hips, and a face bordering on cute rather than handsome, but he was working with what he had just fine.</p> <p>He immediately swept the dove-gray Stetson from his head, revealing dark wavy hair, and smiled at the room like a star granting an audience to his fans.</p> <p>Even though Vesta had yet to meet a man worth her time, she wasn't yet dead and buried. She handed Vera her bowl of salad and scooted toward the counter.</p> <p>"Welcome to The Curl Up and Dye. Can I help you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I sure hope so, darlin'. My name is T. J. Lachlan and I'm new in town. I inherited the old Bissler house from my great-uncle Gene and am staying there while I'm fixing it up to sell. I came in to get a haircut and learned the local barber is in the hospital. When I saw your Walk-Ins Welcome sign, I wondered if I might trouble one of you fine ladies for a trim."</p> <p>"Sure, I have time," Vesta said.</p> <p>Vera glared at her sister, then smirked. "No you don't, Vesta. Sue Beamon is due any minute." She set the bowls with their food back in the break room and sauntered to the front of the store and introduced herself.</p> <p>"Welcome to Blessings, Mr. Lachlan. My name is Vera, and I'd be happy to cut your hair."</p> <p>"Y'all can call me T. J., and isn't this something. Excuse me for saying this, but twins are truly a man's finest fancy," he said, and then flashed them both a wide grin.</p> <p>They didn't know whether to be insulted or impressed by the sexual inference, and Ruby could see it was about to get out of hand.</p> <p>"Vesta, there comes Sue, so Vera can pick up the walk-in. Welcome to Blessings, T. J. Take a seat and we'll get you fixed right up."</p> <p>She arched an eyebrow at the twins as a reminder that this was a place of business, then turned Lily's chair around and the blow-dryer back on. Because LilyAnn's hair was so long, it always took a while to dry. She began working the round vent brush through the lengths while keeping an eye on the clock. Lily only had a limited amount of time, and Ruby didn't want to make her late.</p> <p>It wasn't until she was about through that she realized Lily was staring at the stranger as if she'd seen a ghost.</p> <p>Ruby paused. "Hey. Are you okay?" she whispered.</p> <p>Lily blinked, and when she met Ruby's gaze in the mirror, her eyes were filled with tears.</p> <p>"I'm fine, Sister. He just reminded me of someone." Then she shook her head and looked away.</p> <p>Ruby's eyes narrowed. This was the first time she could remember the woman even showing an interest in another man. Even if it was a negative interest, it was better than nothing.</p> <p>"How about we do something a little different with your hair? Maybe pull the sides away from your face and fasten them up here at the crown...or maybe at the nape of your neck? Hmm? What do you think?"</p> <p>She pulled the sides back and held them up at the crown to show Lily what she was talking about.</p> <p>Lily frowned. Pulling her hair away from her face like that only emphasized her double chin.</p> <p>"I don't know. I guess," she muttered.</p> <p>"Good," Ruby said. "A little change never hurt anyone."</p> <p>With an eye still on the clock, she quickly finished Lily's new look.</p> <p>"There you go. Look how pretty you look like this, and just in time to get back to work before Mr. Phillips can complain."</p> <p>Lily frowned again. She felt naked-like she'd revealed too much of herself. She didn't much like it, but it was too late to change it. She slipped into her jacket and grabbed her purse before scuttling toward the front like a crab going sideways across a beach. Her head was down and her shoulders slumped, operating on the theory that if she couldn't see the hunk, then he couldn't see her.</p> <p>"Same time next week," she said, as she hand...</p></p><h2>Slavecraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude: Principles, Skills and Tools</h2><p>The author of Ties That Bind joins forces with a grateful slave to produce this gripping and personal account on the subject of consensual slavery.

Almost universally ignored, these men and women learned to become their own researchers, lobbyists, and drug smugglers, established their own newspapers and research journals, and went on to force reform in the nation&#x2019;s disease-fighting agencies. From the creator of, and inspired by, the seminal documentary of the same name, <i>How to Survive a Plague</i> is an unparalleled insider&#x2019;s account of a pivotal moment in the history of American civil rights.</p><p><b>DAVID FRANCE&nbsp;</b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>Our Fathers,</i>&nbsp;a book about the Catholic sexual abuse scandal, which Showtime adapted into a film.

The author lives in New York City.&nbsp;<br><br>www.davidfrance.comI didn�t have serious concerns for my own health. What I worried about was Brian Gougeon. I checked on him frequently. Neither of us brought up AIDS directly or his health specifically, though I sensed he resented my calls as reminders of that scare. Like characters in a Saramago novel, we talked about anything else. The news was generally good. He resumed the physically taxing work of tending the vast vertical jungle of ficus trees and philodendron bushes that filled high-rises throughout the city. He confided that the East Village gallery scene had been cool to his work, but reported the good news that he was back with his college boyfriend, and had never been happier. <br><br> I don&#x2019;t want to overstate our sense of impending doom. The truth was, the storm clouds massed near the horizon, not overhead. Unless you were personally admitted into what Susan Sontag called &#x201c;the kingdom of the sick,&#x201d; it was not hard to put the growing epidemic out of mind. It took two years and almost six hundred dead before <i>The New York Times</i> put a story on the front page. Except in passing, few television news programs made any mention. The progressive <i>Village Voice</i> ran a feature that called the danger overblown, and was nearly silent otherwise. You would have to read the <i>Native</i> for news on AIDS. <br><br> Brian Gougeon avoided the newspapers. I know he saw the first major report in prime time, since we watched it together on my small black-and-white TV. The ABC newsman Geraldo Rivera, flamboyant and hyperbolic though he was, broke the near-complete media blackout with the first network broadcast. <br><br> &#x201c;It is the most frightening medical mystery of our time,&#x201d; Rivera said, leaning toward the camera. &#x201c;There is an epidemic loose in the land, a so-far incurable disease which kills its victims in stages.&#x201d; <br><br> And then appeared the face of a man in grotesque medical distress&#x2014; the first plague-sickened man either Brian or I had laid eyes on. He was a freelance lighting designer named Ken Ramsauer, age twenty-seven. In an old photograph, he looked as polished and angular as a shampoo model. The difference between then and now was shocking. His head appeared swollen nearly to the brink of popping; his eyes vanished behind swollen muffins of flesh; oblong purple marks covered his skin. Confined to a wheelchair, he hung his head weakly. A friend handed him a glass of water, which was almost too heavy for his trembling arms. &#x201c;I thought I was a pretty good-looking guy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And now, I actually see myself fading away.&#x201d; <br><br> Ramsauer said he had just returned from the hospital, where they offered him neither medicine nor hope, and least of all pity. &#x201c;One night I heard two, I believe, nurse&#x2019;s aides&#x2014;not the actual nurses&#x2014;standing outside my door sort of laughing,&#x201d; he said. <br><br> &#x201c;What did they say exactly?&#x201d; Rivera asked. <br><br> He blinked his slivered eyes and looked down at the water glass in his scarlet fists, remembering: &#x201c;I wonder how long the faggot in 208 is going to last.&#x201d; <br><br> Four days later, I opened the paper to discover that Ramsauer was dead. When I read that a public memorial was planned at the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park, I asked Brian to go with me. But he was taking a different strategy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just staying out of the whole thing,&#x201d; he said, meaning AIDS. &#x201c;Worrying isn&#x2019;t good for your health. And it does nasty things to your art.&#x201d; <br><br>Instead I went with another friend, a graphic designer named Ian Horst. That evening was unusually still and hot. As we approached the service from the south, beneath a vaulted canopy of American elms and a row of towering statuary, a macabre scene confronted us. The plaza was crowded with 1,500 mourners cupping candles against the darkening sky. As our eyes landed on one young man after another, it became obvious that many of them were seriously ill. A dozen men were in wheelchairs, so wasted they looked like caricatures of starvation. I watched one young man twist in pain that was caused, apparently, by the barest gusts of wind around us. In New York there were just 722 cases reported, half the nation&#x2019;s total. It seemed they were all at the band shell that sweltering evening. <br><br>My friend&#x2019;s mouth hung open. &#x201c;It looks like a horror flick,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> I was speechless. We had found the plague. <br><br> From there, it was an avalanche. A Friday or two later, a colleague from work ran out the door for a weekend of social commitments. He looked as healthy as a soap opera star, which he aspired to be. We never saw him again. I heard from a mutual friend that he was found dead by neighbors the following week, shrunken and hollow, in a room washed in his own feces. In whispers, we wondered if he had taken his own life&#x2014;and debated whether it would be more stoic to face the disease or commit suicide. <br><br>As the summer of 1983 opened, <i>The New York Times</i> finally started covering the plague, but often in bizarre ways. In May, the paper revealed that prisoners on Rikers Island had declared a hunger strike, unwilling to risk using plates or utensils after an inmate dropped dead from AIDS, and a week later reported on a sanitation worker who might have caught AIDS from handling trash. Readers were left more frightened than ever. We read reports of parents who would not go near their infected sons, not even to bid farewell. Many hospital workers felt the same way, abandoning AIDS-sick patients in diarrhea-soaked sheets out of fear and prejudice. Dr. Robert Gallo, head of the Laboratory of Tumor and Cell Biology at the National Cancer Institute, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, was disgusted when he first heard the sick joke that pancakes were the only food fit for an AIDS patient, because they could fit under the door. In this environment, even doctors felt justified to exempt AIDS sufferers from the Hippocratic Oath&#x2014;in one survey, over half admitted they would refuse them medical attention if given a choice. <br><br>The patients&#x2019; indignities did not end with death. Across New York, the global epicenter of this outbreak, almost every undertaker refused to work with the corpses. Even in the ancient plagues of Europe there were individuals tasked with collecting remains. In The Betrothed, the novelist Alessandro Manzoni called them monatti, those unflappable Samaritans who, for profit or otherwise, braved the &#x201c;rags and corrupted bandages, infected straw, or clothes, or sheets&#x201d; to convey the lifeless flesh to the ditches. In New York at the dawn of AIDS, only Redden&#x2019;s Funeral Home, operating continuously since the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918&#x2013;19, would handle the embalming. Yet its owners begged the grateful mourners to keep their kindnesses a secret for fear of boycotts by the aging Catholic community in Greenwich Village and Chelsea, the bulk of their business.</p><h2>Colossus: The Turbulent, Thrilling Saga of the Building of Hoover Dam</h2><p>As breathtaking today as when it was completed, Hoover Dam ranks among America&#x2019;s most awe-inspiring, if dubious, achievements.

It does not rank as the longest river in North America, nor the widest, nor the most abundant. Its drainage basin of a quarter-million square miles barely falls within the ten largest in the United States, and much of it covers inaccessible range or desolate wasteland. Unlike the Mississippi, Hudson, and St. Lawrence, to name three great riparian thoroughfares of the continent, the Colorado has never been a significant bearer of commercial traffic.<br> <br>Throughout history, what has set the Colorado River apart from all other waterways of the Western Hemisphere is its violent personality. The Colorado has always been best known for the scars it left on the landscape, among them the greatest of all natural works, the Grand Canyon, a testament to the river&#x2019;s primordial origin and its compulsive energy. No river equaled its maniacal zeal for carving away the terrain in its path and carrying it downstream, sometimes as far as a thousand miles. No river matched its schizophrenic moods, which could swing in the course of a few hours from that of a meandering country stream to an insane torrent.<br> <br>It is hardly surprising that from ancient times, the humans who coexisted with the Colorado depicted it not as a beneficent life-giving force but as a fiery red monster, a dragon or serpent beyond man&#x2019;s ability to tame.<br> <br>The basin&#x2019;s first recorded inhabitants, the native tribespeople of the southern plains, had no option but to accommodate themselves to the river&#x2019;s implacable temperament. They pastured their livestock on the grass that sprang up in the wake of its floods, planted crops on its rich alluvial deposits, imagined their gods and spirits housed within its labyrinthine canyons, assembled their myths and legends from the raw material of its natural mystery.<br> <br>The American settlers of a later era, driven by the demands of commerce and dreams of wealth, were not so inclined to defer to nature&#x2019;s unpredictable willfulness. From their earliest encounters with the river, they pondered how to corral it, divert it, drain it, and consume it. The California engineer Joseph Barlow Lippincott, dispatched to the river by the city of Los Angeles in 1912, pronounced it &#x201c;an American Nile awaiting regulation&#x201d;&#x2014;to be best treated &#x201c;in as intelligent and vigorous a manner as the British government has treated its great Egyptian prototype.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lippincott&#x2019;s judgment reflected a new conservation policy then taking root in the United States. It was based on defining conservation not as protection or preservation but as exploitation. Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s interior secretary, Franklin K. Lane, laid out the new approach with striking directness. &#x201c;Every tree is a challenge to us, and every pool of water and every foot of soil,&#x201d; he proclaimed. &#x201c;The mountains are our enemies. We must pierce them and make them serve. The sinful rivers we must curb.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lane&#x2019;s successors answered his call to arms. Over the following decades, the U.S. government carried out an ambitious program to harness the sinful Colorado, working the river until the volume remaining to trickle into the sea scarcely merited an asterisk on a hydrological graph. The architects of this program couched their intentions in moral terms, as though they were not altering the natural order but restoring the watershed to a state of grace. &#x201c;The Colorado River flows uselessly past the international desert which Nature intended for its bride,&#x201d; wrote William Ellsworth Smythe, the most prominent water evangelist of his era, in 1900. &#x201c;Some time the wedding of the waters to the soil will be celebrated, and the child of that union will be a new civilization.&#x201d;<br> <br>What first lured Europeans to the banks of the Colorado, however, was not its potential to nurture crops. It was gold. Or, more precisely, the mirage of gold.<br> <br>The Spanish conquistadors, led by Hern�n Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, had completed their plunder of the Inca and Aztec empires of the New World before the sixteenth century was three decades old. They had looted the Indians&#x2019; storehouses, exhausted their mines, and worked legions of slaves to death. Yet their appetite for gold, silver, and gemstones remained unquenched.<br> <br>Fortuitously, hints of new treasures soon emerged from the uncharted north, reenergizing the Spanish quest. In the mid-1530s, adventurers returned from Indian imprisonment in the Sonoran Desert&#x2014;present-day New Mexico and Arizona&#x2014;laden with news of a land called Cibola, where stood seven magnificent cities in which (according to the yarn one traveler spun for his relatives) &#x201c;the women wore strands of gold and the men golden waistbands&#x201d; and the palace walls were encrusted with emeralds.<br> <br>Lured by this vision of wealth, the conquistadors probed along the Sea of Cortez (the Gulf of California) until they encountered, inevitably, the Colorado delta. The first advance parties were driven back by the ferocious tides at the confluence of the river and gulf. Finally, in 1539, a ship under the tenacious command of Captain Hernando de Alarc�n managed to sail upriver about 150 miles, penetrating well into Sonora. He was shortly followed by an immense force under the command of General Francisco V�squez de Coronado, dispatched to explore the beckoning golden empire by land.<br> <br>Coronado&#x2019;s scouts were soon filling in the blank maps of the Southwest. They renamed the Colorado the Rio del Tison, or Firebrand River&#x2014;not because of its willfulness, but for the torches the local Indians bore on their travels&#x2014;and they came upon the Grand Canyon, reporting the immense natural formation with appropriate wonderment.<br> <br>But their quest for gold failed. A pueblo city that scouts had described as ringed with gilded ramparts proved to be built of mere mud and clay, which happened to glimmer deceptively in the setting sun. The other majestic cities of Cibola remained as elusive as phantasms. For two more years<br> <br>Coronado searched for gold, finally returning home empty-handed and deeply in debt.<br> <br>Yet there was gold in the north, just not where he had been looking for it. Another three centuries would pass before its discovery would attract white Americans in great numbers back to what had long since been written off as a hopelessly unprepossessing territory. The Gold Rush of 1849 would draw ninety thousand fortune seekers, known as Forty-niners or Argonauts, to ford the Colorado River&#x2014;part of a migration of men, women, and families that has been called &#x201c;the largest single western movement in the nation&#x2019;s history.&#x201d;<br> <br>The frenzy began with an unassuming item on an inside page of the <i>San Francisco Californian</i> of March 15, 1848, headlined, &#x201c;GOLD MINE FOUND.&#x201d; It did not fully take root in the national consciousness until nine months later, when President James K. Polk gave the federal government&#x2019;s imprimatur to the discovery at Sutter&#x2019;s Mill. As an expansionist, Polk made no effort to downplay a discovery likely to encourage new settlement in an underpopulated region. Instead, he reported in his annual message to Congress on December 5 that &#x201c;the explorations already made warrant the belief that the supply is very large.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some 300,000 Argonauts struck out for the West, a third of them taking what became known as the southern routes&#x2014;overland byways converging at Yuma, Arizona, where the Gila River joined the Colorado, and continuing along one or another waterless trail, or jornada, toward the Pacific coast. These trails acquired a vicious reputation. One in particular, a desert crossing paralleling the Rio Grande in New Mexico, bore a label that presently was applied to the entire unspeakably harsh road west. It was known in Spanish as <i>la jornada de la muerte;</i> in English as &#x201c;the journey of death.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perils of every variety confronted travelers on the jornada: disease, brigands, hostile tribes, and the daunting terrain itself. Not even the best-out-fitted expeditions were immune. This was shown by the dire experience of John Woodhouse Audubon, the renowned naturalist&#x2019;s younger son, who left New York for the Texas coast and points west with a party of eighty, backed by what was regarded as lavish capital of $27,000.<br> <br>On the day of his departure, Audubon was a youthful thirty-six, &#x201c;tall, strong and alert,&#x201d; in the words of his daughter Maria. When he returned home a year later he was broken, &#x201c;worn out in body and spirit&#x201d; by his travails on the Jornada and the loss at sea of all his sketches and most of his notebooks.<br> <br>The first blow to strike Audubon&#x2019;s company had been cholera, which killed five members within days of their landing in Texas and reduced a dozen others to dehydrated wraiths. The survivors pressed on, Audubon collecting botanical specimens and sketching wildlife in his father&#x2019;s style. In mid-October he and his remaining companions reached the junction of the Gila and the Colorado, which he dismissed as merely a &#x201c;muddy stream.&#x201d; Crossing to the opposite bank and clambering up a sand dune, he perceived a further omen of the dismal prospects facing the expedition. He was perched upon a desert ridge that belonged to the &#x201c;walking hills&#x201d; of California, a natural barrier that would obstruct men&#x2019;s activities in the region for the next half-century. &#x201c;There was not a tree to be seen, nor the least sign of vegetation, and the sun pouring down on us made our journey seem twice the length it really was.&#x201d;<br> <br>The next day Audubon&#x2019;s group came upon a chain of fetid lagoons, where they deduced the fate of their numberless predecessors from the detritus scattered on the ground. &#x201c;Truly here was a scene of desolation,&#x201d; he wrote.<br> <br>Broken wagons, dead shriveled up cattle, horses and mules as well, lay baking in the sun, around the dried-up wells that had been opened, in the hopes of getting water. Not a blade of grass or green thing of any kind relieved the monotony of the parched, ash-colored earth, and the most melancholy scene presented itself that I have seen since I left the Rio Grande.<br> <br>They could hardly have suspected, slogging through the vacant wastes and slaking their thirst from pools of water described by a fellow traveler as &#x201c;a tincture of bluelick, iodides of sulphur, Epsom salts, and a strong decoction of decomposed mule flesh,&#x201d; that they were crossing the grounds of a future paradise. The introduction of fresh water to the Imperial Valley and the dam that would impound it lay decades in the future. But the Argonauts&#x2019; journeys marked a vital step in the process. The Gold Rush awoke official Washington to the military and economic significance of America&#x2019;s western territories and to the necessity of acquiring firsthand testimony about what lay between the frontier and the Pacific coast.<br> <br>One of the prime movers of what became known as the Great Reconnaissance was President Franklin Pierce&#x2019;s secretary of war, Jefferson Davis.<br> <br>The desert held a peculiar fascination for Jeff Davis. As a U.S. senator, he had risked public ridicule by proposing to deploy camels in the Southwest as a military experiment. Upon joining the cabinet in 1853, he put his plan into action by importing fifty of the animals for his department, but the program collapsed four years later, following his and President Pierce&#x2019;s departure from power.<br> <br>A more enduring mark was left by the survey Davis commissioned to identify a Southwestern route for an intercontinental railroad. The reports from his five survey parties later published in twelve majestic volumes-America&#x2019;s most important exploratory record since Lewis and Clark&#x2014;contained a wealth of information about the vast region&#x2019;s topography, geology, wildlife, and natural history.<br> <br>Attached to the survey was William Phipps Blake, a young geologist from a prominent Eastern family. Blake&#x2019;s party failed to discern a suitable railroad route, but he did stumble upon a remarkable geologic feature in the trackless desert. His first clue that he had found something extraordinary came on November 17, 1853, when from the edge of a windswept ridge in the San Bernardino Mountains (not far from the site of modern Palm Springs) he noticed &#x201c;a discoloration of the rocks extending for a long distance in a horizontal line on the side of the mountains.&#x201d;<br> <br>With great excitement, Blake worked his way down the gradient. From the valley floor the line &#x201c;could be traced along the mountain sides, following all the angles and sinuosities of the ridges for many miles&#x2014;always preserving its horizontality&#x2014;sometimes being high up above the plain, and again intersecting long and high slopes of gravel and sand; on such places a beach-line could be read.&#x201d;<br> <br>The conclusion was inescapable: he was standing in the dry bed of an immense ancient sea, and the white line was its high water mark.<br> <br>Blake named the sea Lake Cohuilla, after the local Indian tribe. The white deposit, he determined, was composed of the fossilized shells of freshwater animals. His barometer told him that his location measured at least one hundred feet below sea level. From the Indians he learned that the valley served as the traditional locus of their own flood legend, &#x201c;a tradition they have of a great water (agua grande) which covered the whole valley and was filled with fine fish. . . . Their fathers lived in the mountains and used to come down to the lake to fish and hunt. The water gradually subsided &#x2018;poco,&#x2019; &#x2018;poco,&#x2019; (little by little,) and their villages were moved down from the mountains, into the valley it had left. They also said that the waters once returned very suddenly and overwhelmed many of their people and drove the rest back to the mountains.&#x201d;<br> <br>The desert was shaped like an oblong bowl rising from a central depression, or &#x201c;sink,&#x201d; about one hundred miles west of the Colorado River and deeper at its lowest point than Death Valley. The region&#x2019;s rainfall of less than three inches a year, the continent&#x2019;s most meager, had created over the eons a terrain as empty as the Arabian wastes. Where there was any vegetation at all, it was of the lowliest variety, resinous greasewood and creosote whose roots clung like talons to the sun-hardened earth.<br> <br>Yet Blake was not fooled by the apparent lifelessness of the cracked and sere clay veneer. &#x201c;The alluvial soil of the Desert is capable of sustaining a vigorous vegetation,&#x201d; he reported. &#x201c;If a supply of water could be obtained for irrigation, it is probable that the greater part of the Desert could be made to yield crops of almost any kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>The desert was in fact a deposit of rich soil eroded by the Colorado River from the basin upstream and transported south at the rate of 160 million tons a year. Working on millennial time, the silt filled in the shallow headwaters of the Gulf of California, shifting its shore 150 miles southward. This process turned the gulf&#x2019;s northernmost arm into the landlocked lake later known as the Salton Sea. As the lake slowly evaporated, it left behind a crust of mineral salt and calcified shells, the remnants of which Blake had spotted.<br> <br>Meanwhile, the river built up its bed with its own silt deposits year after year, like a train laying its own tracks. Eventually the river would be flowing within parallel levees elevated high above the desert floor. In time the levees would become unstable, their walls would collapse, and the stream, freed of its constraints, would inundate the desert basin, recharging the inland sea.

Will the curious little monkey help make a big discovery?<br><br>The paperback edition of this new adventure contains a word jumble as well as finger puppets for children to photocopy, color, and cut out.</p><p><p><b>Hans </b>and <b>Margret Rey </b>created many books during their lives together, including <i>Curious George</i>, one of the most treasured classics of all time, as well as other favorites like <i>Spotty </i>and <i>Pretzel.</i> But it was their rambunctious little monkey who became an instantly recognizable icon. After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original <i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on PBS.<br> </p></p><h2>Neighborhood Defenders: Participatory Politics and America&#39;s Housing Crisis</h2><p>Since the collapse of the housing market in 2008, demand for housing has consistently outpaced supply in many US communities. The failure to construct sufficient housing - especially affordable housing - in desirable communities and neighborhoods comes with significant social, economic, and environmental costs. This book examines how local participatory land use institutions amplify the power of entrenched interests and privileged homeowners. The book draws on sweeping data to examine the dominance of land use politics by &#39;neighborhood defenders&#39; - individuals who oppose new housing projects far more strongly than their broader communities and who are likely to be privileged on a variety of dimensions. Neighborhood defenders participate disproportionately and take advantage of land use regulations to restrict the construction of multifamily housing. The result is diminished housing stock and higher housing costs, with participatory institutions perversely reproducing inequality.</p><p>Neighborhood Defenders reveals how local politics contributes to the current housing crisis - by empowering unrepresentative groups of privileged homeowners to restrict the supply of new housing through participatory housing permitting processes. Their participation exacerbates inequality and reduces new housing in the places that most need it.Katherine Levine Einstein is Assistant Professor of Political Science and Faculty Fellow at the Initiative on Cities at Boston University.<br><br>David M.

Drawing on their research, the authors show how we are prisoners of our own assumptions. They identify strategies to avoid these pitfalls in negotiating by concentrating on opponents&#x2019; behavior and developing the ability to recognize individual limitations and biases. They explain how to think rationally about the choice of reaching an agreement versus reaching an impasse.

That&#x2019;s just how it is.<br> <br>Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t agree needs their head examined.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what Elsa&#x2019;s granny says, at least.<br> <br>Elsa is seven, going on eight. She knows she isn&#x2019;t especially good at being seven. She knows she&#x2019;s different. Her headmaster says she needs to &#x201c;fall into line&#x201d; in order to achieve &#x201c;a better fit with her peers.&#x201d; Other adults describe her as &#x201c;very grown-up for her age.&#x201d; Elsa knows this is just another way of saying &#x201c;massively annoying for her age,&#x201d; because they only tend to say this when she corrects them for mispronouncing &#x201c;d�j� vu&#x201d; or not being able to tell the difference between &#x201c;me&#x201d; and &#x201c;I&#x201d; at the end of a sentence. Smart-asses usually can&#x2019;t, hence the &#x201c;grown-up for her age&#x201d; comment, generally said with a strained smile at her parents. As if she has a mental impairment, as if Elsa has shown them up by not being totally thick just because she&#x2019;s seven. And that&#x2019;s why she doesn&#x2019;t have any friends except Granny. Because all the other seven-year-olds in her school are as idiotic as seven-year-olds tend to be, but Elsa is different.<br> <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny. Because all the best people are different&#x2014;look at superheroes. After all, if superpowers were normal, everyone would have them.<br> <br>Granny is seventy-seven years old, going on seventy-eight. She&#x2019;s not very good at it either. You can tell she&#x2019;s old because her face looks like newspaper stuffed into wet shoes, but no one ever accuses Granny of being grown-up for her age. &#x201c;Perky,&#x201d; people sometimes say to Elsa&#x2019;s mum, looking either fairly worried or fairly angry as Mum sighs and asks how much she owes for the damages. Or when Granny&#x2019;s smoking at the hospital sets the fire alarm off and she starts ranting and raving about how &#x201c;everything has to be so bloody politically correct these days!&#x201d; when the security guards make her extinguish her cigarette. Or that time she made a snowman in Britt-Marie and Kent&#x2019;s garden right under their balcony and dressed it up in grown-up clothes so it looked as if a person had fallen from the roof. Or that time those prim men wearing spectacles started ringing all the doorbells and wanted to talk about God and Jesus and heaven, and Granny stood on her balcony with her dressing gown flapping open, shooting at them with her paintball gun, and Britt-Marie couldn&#x2019;t quite decide if she was most annoyed about the paintball-gun thing or the not-wearing-anything-under-the-dressing-gown thing, but she reported both to the police just to be on the safe side.<br> <br>Those are the times, Elsa supposes, that people find Granny perky for her age.<br> <br>They also say that Granny is mad, but in actual fact she&#x2019;s a genius. It&#x2019;s just that she&#x2019;s a bit of a crackpot at the same time. She used to be a doctor, and she won prizes and journalists wrote articles about her and she went to all the most terrible places in the world when everyone else was getting out. She saved lives and fought evil everywhere on earth. As superheroes do.<br> <br>But one day someone decided she was too old to save lives, even if Elsa quite strongly suspects what they really meant by &#x201c;too old&#x201d; was &#x201c;too crazy.&#x201d; Granny refers to this person as &#x201c;Society&#x201d; and says it&#x2019;s only because everything has to be so bloody politically correct nowadays that she&#x2019;s no longer allowed to make incisions in people. And that it was really mainly about Society getting so bleeding fussy about the smoking ban in the operating theaters, and who could work under those sorts of conditions?<br> <br>So now she&#x2019;s mainly at home driving Britt-Marie and Mum around the bend. Britt-Marie is Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, Mum is Elsa&#x2019;s mum. And really Britt-Marie is also Elsa&#x2019;s mum&#x2019;s neighbor because Elsa&#x2019;s mum lives next door to Elsa&#x2019;s granny. And Elsa obviously also lives next door to Granny, because Elsa lives with her mum. Except every other weekend, when she lives with Dad and Lisette. And of course George is also Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, because he lives with Mum. It&#x2019;s a bit all over the place.<br> <br>But anyway, to get back to the point: lifesaving and driving people nuts are Granny&#x2019;s superpowers. Which perhaps makes her a bit of a dysfunctional superhero. Elsa knows this because she looked up &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; on Wikipedia. People of Granny&#x2019;s age describe Wikipedia as &#x201c;an encyclopedia, but on the net!&#x201d; Encyclopedias are what Elsa describes as &#x201c;Wikipedia, but analog.&#x201d; Elsa has checked &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; in both places and it means that something is not quite functioning as it&#x2019;s supposed to. Which is one of Elsa&#x2019;s favorite things about her granny.<br> <br>But maybe not today. Because it&#x2019;s half past one in the morning and Elsa is fairly tired and would really like to go back to bed. Except that&#x2019;s not going to happen, because Granny&#x2019;s been throwing turds at a policeman.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a little complicated.<br> <br><br> <br>Elsa looks around the little rectangular room and yawns listlessly and so widely that she looks like she&#x2019;s trying to swallow her own head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did tell you not to climb the fence,&#x201d; she mutters, checking her watch.<br> <br>Granny doesn&#x2019;t answer. Elsa takes off her Gryffindor scarf and puts it in her lap. She was born on Boxing Day seven years ago (almost eight). The same day some German scientists recorded the strongest-ever emission of gamma radiation from a magnetar over the earth. Admittedly Elsa doesn&#x2019;t know what a magnetar is, but it&#x2019;s some kind of neutron star. And it sounds a little like &#x201c;Megatron,&#x201d; which is the name of the evil one in Transformers, which is what simpletons who don&#x2019;t read enough quality literature call &#x201c;a children&#x2019;s program.&#x201d; In actual fact the Transformers are robots, but if you look at it academically they could also be counted as superheroes. Elsa is very keen on both Transformers and neutron stars, and she imagines that an &#x201c;emission of gamma radiation&#x201d; would look a bit like that time Granny spilled Fanta on Elsa&#x2019;s iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster. And Granny says it makes Elsa special to have been born on a day like that. And being special is the best way of being different.<br> <br>Granny is busy distributing small heaps of tobacco all over the wooden table in front of her and rolling them into rustling cigarette papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I told you not to climb the fence!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny makes a snorting sound and searches the pockets of her much-too-large overcoat for a lighter. She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be taking any of this very seriously, mainly because she never seems to take anything seriously. Except when she wants to smoke and can&#x2019;t find a lighter.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; she says breezily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to get worked up about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you &#x2018;for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2019; me! You&#x2019;re the one who threw shit at the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop fussing. You sound like your mother. Do you have a lighter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m seven!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long are you going to use that as an excuse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Until I&#x2019;m not seven anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny mumbles something that sounds like &#x201c;Not a crime to ask, is it?&#x201d; and continues rifling through her pockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you can smoke in here, actually,&#x201d; Elsa informs her, sounding calmer now and fingering the long rip in the Gryffindor scarf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Course you can smoke. We&#x2019;ll just open a window.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa looks skeptically at the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re the sort of windows that open.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got bars on them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny glares with dissatisfaction at the windows. And then at Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;So now you can&#x2019;t even smoke at the police station. Jesus. It&#x2019;s like being in 1984.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa yawns again. &#x201c;Can I borrow your phone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To check something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Online.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You invest too much time on that Internet stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean, &#x2018;spend.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What I mean is, you don&#x2019;t use &#x2018;invest&#x2019; in that way. You wouldn&#x2019;t go round saying, &#x2018;I invested two hours in reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone,&#x2019; would you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just rolls her eyes and hands her the phone. &#x201c;Did you ever hear about the girl who blew up because she did too much thinking?&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman who shuffles into the room looks very, very tired.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my lawyer,&#x201d; Granny demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my mum!&#x201d; Elsa demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case I want to call my lawyer first!&#x201d; Granny insists.<br> <br>The policeman sits down opposite them and fidgets with a little pile of papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother is on her way,&#x201d; he says to Elsa with a sigh.<br> <br>Granny makes the sort of dramatic gasp that only Granny knows how to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you call her? Are you mad?&#x201d; she protests, as if the policeman just told her he was going to leave Elsa in the forest to be raised by a pack of wolves. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be bloody livid!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to call the child&#x2019;s legal guardian,&#x201d; the policeman explains calmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am also the child&#x2019;s legal guardian! I am the child&#x2019;s grandmother!&#x201d; Granny fumes, rising slightly out of her chair and shaking her unlit cigarette menacingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s half past one in the morning. Someone has to take care of the child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, me! I&#x2019;m taking care of the child!&#x201d; she splutters.<br> <br>The policeman makes a fairly strained attempt to gesture amicably across the interrogation room.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how do you feel it&#x2019;s going so far?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny looks slightly offended.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . everything was going just fine until you started chasing me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You broke into a zoo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing as a &#x2018;tiny&#x2019; burglary.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny shrugs and makes a brushing movement over the table, as if she thinks they&#x2019;ve stretched this out long enough. The policeman notices the cigarette and eyes it dubiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on! I can smoke in here, can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head sternly. Granny leans forward, looks him deep in the eyes, and smiles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you make an exception? Not even for little old me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa gives Granny a little shove in the side and switches to their secret language. Because Granny and Elsa have a secret language, as all grannies must have with their grandchildren, because by law that&#x2019;s a requirement, says Granny. Or at least it should be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop it, Granny. It&#x2019;s, like, illegal to flirt with policemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Says who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, the police for starters!&#x201d; Elsa replies.<br> <br>&#x201c;The police are supposed to be there for the sake of the citizens,&#x201d; Granny hisses. &#x201c;I pay my taxes, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman looks at them as you do when a seven-year-old and a seventy-seven-year-old start arguing in a secret language in a police station in the middle of the night. Then Granny&#x2019;s eyelashes tremble alluringly at him as she once again points pleadingly at her cigarette, but when he shakes his head, Granny leans back in the chair and exclaims in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, this political correctness! It&#x2019;s worse than apartheid for smokers in this bloody country nowadays!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you spell that?&#x201d; asks Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Granny sighs as you do when precisely the whole world is against you, even though you pay taxes.<br> <br>&#x201c;That apartight thing,&#x201d; says Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;A-p-p-a-r-t-e-i-d,&#x201d; Granny spells.<br> <br>Elsa immediately Googles it on Granny&#x2019;s phone. It takes her a few attempts&#x2014;Granny&#x2019;s always been a terrible speller. Meanwhile the policeman explains that they&#x2019;ve decided to let them go, but Granny will be called in at a later date to explain the burglary and &#x201c;other aggravations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What aggravations?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Driving illegally, to begin with.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, illegally? That&#x2019;s my car! I don&#x2019;t need permission to drive my own car, do I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; replies the policeman patiently, &#x201c;but you need a driver&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny throws out her arms in exasperation. She&#x2019;s just launched into another rant about this being a Big Brother society when Elsa whacks the phone sharply against the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got NOTHING to do with that apartheid thing!!! You compared not being able to smoke with apartheid and it&#x2019;s not the same thing at all. It&#x2019;s not even CLOSE!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny waves her hand resignedly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I meant it was . . . you know, more or less like that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t at all!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a metaphor, for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bloody crap metaphor!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How would you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;WIKIPEDIA!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny turns in defeat to the policeman. &#x201c;Do your children carry on like this?&#x201d; The policeman looks uncomfortable.<br> <br>&#x201c;We . . . don&#x2019;t let the children surf the Net unsupervised. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny stretches out her arms towards Elsa, a gesture that seems to say &#x201c;You see!&#x201d; Elsa just shakes her head and crosses her arms very hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Granny, just say sorry for throwing turds at the police, and we can go home,&#x201d; she snorts in the secret language, though still very expressly upset about that whole apartheid thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; says Granny in the secret language.<br> <br>&#x201c;To the police, not me, you muppet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be no apologizing to fascists here. I pay my taxes. And you&#x2019;re the muppet.&#x201d; Granny sulks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Takes one to know one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then they both sit with their arms crossed, demonstratively looking away from each other, until Granny nods at the policeman and says in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you be kind enough to let my spoilt granddaughter know that if she takes this attitude, she&#x2019;s quite welcome to walk home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her I&#x2019;m going home with Mum and she&#x2019;s the one who can walk!&#x201d; Elsa replies at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell HER she can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman stands up without a word, walks out of the room and closes the door behind him, as if intending to go into another room and bury his head in a large, soft cushion and yell as loud as he can.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now look what you did,&#x201d; says Granny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look what YOU did!&#x201d;<br> <br>Eventually a heavyset policewoman with piercing green eyes comes in instead. It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the first time she&#x2019;s run into Granny, because she smiles in that tired way so typical of people who know Granny, and says: &#x201c;You have to stop doing this, we also have real criminals to worry about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just mumbles, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stop, yourselves?&#x201d; And then they&#x2019;re allowed to go home.<br> <br>Standing on the pavement waiting for her mother, Elsa fingers the rip in her scarf. It goes right through the Gryffindor emblem. She tries as hard as she can not to cry but doesn&#x2019;t make much of a success of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, your mum can mend that,&#x201d; says Granny, trying to be cheerful, giving her a little punch on the shoulder.<br> <br>Elsa looks up anxiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;And, you know . . . we can tell your mum the scarf got torn when you were trying to stop me climbing the fence to get to the monkeys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa nods and runs her fingers over the scarf again. It didn&#x2019;t get torn when Granny was climbing the fence. It got torn at school when three older girls who hate Elsa without Elsa really understanding why got hold of her outside the cafeteria and hit her and tore her scarf and threw it down the toilet.

And for far too many students, that fear is realized. Research has shown that by the time they graduate, as many as one in three women and almost one in six men will have been sexually assaulted. But why is sexual assault such a common feature of college life? And what can be done to prevent it? <em>Sexual Citizens</em> provides answers. Drawing on the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation (SHIFT) at Columbia University, the most comprehensive study of sexual assault on a campus to date, Jennifer S. Hirsch and Shamus Khan present an entirely new framework that emphasizes sexual assault&#x2019;s social roots, transcending current debates about consent, predators in a &#x201c;hunting ground,&#x201d; and the dangers of hooking up.</p><p><em>Sexual Citizens</em> is based on years of research interviewing and observing college life&#x2015;with students of different races, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Hirsch and Khan&#x2019;s landmark study reveals the social ecosystem that makes sexual assault so predictable, explaining how physical spaces, alcohol, peer groups, and cultural norms influence young people&#x2019;s experiences and interpretations of both sex and sexual assault. Through the powerful concepts of &#x201c;sexual projects,&#x201d; &#x201c;sexual citizenship,&#x201d; and &#x201c;sexual geographies,&#x201d; the authors offer a new and widely-accessible language for understanding the forces that shape young people&#x2019;s sexual relationships. Empathetic, insightful, and far-ranging, <em>Sexual Citizens</em> transforms our understanding of sexual assault and offers a roadmap for how to address it.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jennifer S. Hirsch</strong> is professor of sociomedical sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, and codirects SHIFT, the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation, at Columbia University.</p><p><strong>Shamus Khan</strong> is a professor and chair of sociology at Columbia University, and coheads the ethnographic team of SHIFT, the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation, at Columbia University</p>&#x201c;A timely and sweeping reassessment of campus sexual assault. Hirsch and Khan bring rich data and trenchant insight to bear on one of today&#x2019;s most urgent issues. This is an exemplary work, sensitive to intersecting inequalities, that represents the future of social science. Provocative and profoundly relevant, <em>Sexual Citizens</em> opens up the possibility of crafting policies that engage the complicated realities of students&#x2019; lives with honesty and empathy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alondra Nelson, president of the Social Science Research Council</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This extraordinary book situates campus sexual assault in context. It teaches us how any particular sexual encounter is shaped as much by the people involved as it is by the history and prior education of the participants, by economic inequality, by the physical and social geography in which they are living. All of us with a responsibility for creating the campus spaces that can generate&#x2015;or harm&#x2015;health need to read this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sandro Galea, Dean and Robert A. Knox Professor, School of Public Health, Boston University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Written with humanity and sharp sociological insight, Hirsch and Khan&#x2019;s ecological approach moves beyond the adversarial model that has embroiled debates on campus sexual assault. It opens up new ways for thinking about&#x2015;and responding to&#x2015;the pressing problem of sexual assault on college campuses. <em>Sexual Citizens</em> will be essential reading for parents, young people, medical professionals, and educators.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jennifer Cole, professor and chair, Department of Comparative Human Development, University of Chicago</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Sexual Citizens</em> uses careful research to start new conversations about the problem of campus sexual assaults and how to prevent them. The book is grounded in young peoples&#x2019; lived experiences and voices. The authors help students, parents, educators, and preventionists consider how young adults build healthy intimate relationships and how institutions of higher education can create contexts that reduce rates of coercion and sexual violence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Victoria Banyard, professor, School of Social Work and associate director, Center on Violence Against Women and Children, Rutgers University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hirsch and Khan&#x2019;s systematic public health approach to campus sexual assault not only urges empathic action but also outlines possible solutions to this communal problem.

Sterk, president and Charles Howard Candler Professor of Public Health, Emory University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Timely, authentic, and revolutionary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>J. Dennis Fortenberry, Donald Orr Professor of Adolescent Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A comprehensive, brilliant, ground-breaking study of sexual assault on an Ivy League campus. Guided by the voices of a broad swath of students and their often heart-rending stories, the authors propose a comprehensive plan for cultivating sexual citizenship that would replace the &#x2018;hook-up culture&#x2019; with education that enables students to focus on rights, bodily autonomy and empathy in their sexual projects.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Louise Lamphere, Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Emerita, University of New Mexico</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hirsch and Kahn&#x2019;s careful analysis moves us past debates over individual choices or motivations to help us understand the social ecology of campus sexual interactions, consensual and nonconsensual alike.

It was January in Wichita.</p><p>He watched as a thing of beauty made a turn and rolled toward him. It bore his tail number, but not on the tail&#x2014;on the engine nacelles. Its white fuselage bore stripes of blue and red, sweeping back to a night-blue tail, emblazoned with stars. It was his brand-new Citation M2, for which he had waited two years. The form of the delivery pilot, a man named Pat Frank, could be seen in the pilot&#x2019;s seat, having flown the twenty-minute flight from the factory, in Independence, Kansas.</p><p>A lineman ran forward and chocked the nosewheel, and the pilot cut the engines, their dying whine leaving the howl of the wind as the only noise on the ramp.</p><p>Stone had spent the past sixteen days in the classroom and the simulator; the content of his life had shrunk to sweating out instruction all day, then ordering room service at night and falling asleep in front of the TV. He wanted the real airplane and he wanted New York. Now.</p><p>The door of the airplane swung open and a figure kicked the folding steps down, and Stone got his first surprise of the day. The ferry pilot descended onto the tarmac, and her blond hair streamed with the wind. &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she said, holding out a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Pat Frank. Can we get out of this wind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; Stone said, running for the airplane and climbing the steps. He glanced into the cockpit, which was completely familiar to him, since the three fourteen-inch screens of the Garmin 3000 avionics and the accompanying switches and throttles were identical to those in the simulator. He sank into one of the four comfortable passenger seats and waved Ms. Pat Frank to a seat facing him. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re the hand-holder my insurance company sent to make my first flight with me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I am that,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;At the very least. You may recall that you paid me to do the acceptance flights and inspections for you, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I thought I was signing checks to some grizzled veteran of the airlines, corporate flying, and, maybe, FedEx.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all that, except the grizzled part,&#x201d; she said, smiling, revealing perfect teeth set off by her red lipstick. The soft, goatskin leather jacket, zipped up against the weather, could not conceal her ample breasts. &#x201c;All we need is fuel and a flight plan filed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken care of both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope to God you don&#x2019;t want to do the walk-around inspection in this wind,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already done it this morning in a nice warm hangar, and if you want to get me off this airplane you&#x2019;re going to have to drag me.&#x201d;</p><p>A lineman stuck his head into the cabin. &#x201c;Fuel&#x2019;s on the way,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You want me to stow your bags, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d;</p><p>Pat Frank handed him a key. &#x201c;Up front, please, and kindly remove the ten bags of lead shot first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lead shot?&#x201d; Stone asked, baffled.</p><p>&#x201c;Weight and balance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My hundred and twenty pounds weren&#x2019;t enough to get us into the envelope. With you aboard, no problem, unless you have plans to have some slip of a girl fly the airplane alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t think of one,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;ve already been to the can, let&#x2019;s button this thing up, then climb into the cockpit and see if we can make it fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After you,&#x201d; Stone said, stripping off his trench coat.</p><p>She pulled up the steps, closed the door, and swung the lever that locked it. In a moment, she was in the copilot&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>Stone went forward and, with some difficulty, managed to get his six-foot-two frame into the pilot&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>Pat helped him with adjusting the seat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s snug, but you&#x2019;ll get used to it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For some reason, Cessna puts all the room in the rear, where the passengers sit&#x2014;not where the owner-pilots for whom this airplane was intended fly the thing.&#x201d;</p><p>She read out the pre-start checklist, he flipped the appropriate switches, then he turned on the power and the three glass panels slowly came to life, along with the two smaller screens just ahead of the throttles, called the GTUs. These were the iPad-like units with which most of the airplane&#x2019;s systems were operated. Stone had spent a week playing with a computer-simulated version, memorizing the patterns and trying to forget the old G-1000 in his former airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you have a Mustang before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, I gave it to my son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope he&#x2019;s older than eight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite a toy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s twelve, or so, and he&#x2019;s already type-rated.&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I never heard of a father giving his son a jet airplane.&#x201d; She watched as he managed to tap a flight plan into the GTU, then run the system checks. &#x201c;Not bad for a first flight,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;They drilled me well in class. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll need your help before long.&#x201d;</p><p>Outside, the fuel truck drove away, and the lineman signaled that the chocks had been pulled. Stone pulled the hand brake and started the engines. When all systems were running smoothly, he listened to ATIS, the tower&#x2019;s recorded weather report, then called clearance delivery, adjusting the microphone attached to his Bose headset. &#x201c;Wichita clearance delivery, November One Two Three Tango Foxtrot is IFR to Tango Echo Bravo. Do you have a clearance for me?&#x201d;</p><p>They did, and Stone copied it down and read it back. It included a departure procedure, and he inserted that into his electronic flight plan, then called for permission to taxi. &#x201c;Thank God that wind is right down the runway,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like fighting it.&#x201d; He taxied to the end of the runway, and Pat read out the pre-takeoff checklist. With every switch in its proper position, he asked permission to take off and was cleared. He rolled onto the runway, lined up with the centerline, centered the heading bug, flipped on the pitot heat switches, and pushed the throttles to the firewall.</p><p>&#x201c;Airspeed&#x2019;s alive,&#x201d; Pat said after a few seconds, then, &#x201c;Seventy knots&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aaaand rotate!&#x201d;</p><p>Stone put both hands on the yoke and pulled back until two V-bars on the display in front of him mated, showing that he had achieved the proper climb angle.</p><p>&#x201c;Positive rate of climb,&#x201d; Pat said.</p><p>Stone raised the landing gear flaps.</p><p>&#x201c;Four hundred fifty feet,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He pressed the button that turned on the autopilot, then removed his hands from the yoke. They were given an initial climb to ten thousand feet, and he was told to switch to Wichita departure. The frequency was already entered into the G-3000; all he had to do was tap the glass panel at the proper spot. &#x201c;Wichita departure, N123TF with you out of three thousand for one zero thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;N123TF, cleared on course. Climb and maintain flight level 410.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone repeated the instruction and pressed the NAV button to tell the autopilot to follow the flight plan, then he dialed forty-one thousand feet into the computer, pressed the Flight Level Control button, and sat back.</p><p>He put behind him the claustrophobic previous two weeks and room-service food, and reveled in his new airplane as it climbed quickly to FL 410.</p><p>&#x201c;Does your wife fly?&#x201d; Pat asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a widower,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;For some years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My condolences.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you. Why don&#x2019;t you delay your return to Wichita, and let&#x2019;s have dinner tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m moving into a new apartment tomorrow in New York,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>THE FLIGHT was predictably smooth for the first hour. They grilled each other, this being more of a first date than a qualifying flight for the insurance company. Pat was from a small town in Georgia, Delano, which somehow had a familiar ring for Stone. She had started flying after college, had flown air taxi and package delivery, then corporate jets, then for an airline. By the time that went bust, she had made captain, and she took herself to another airline. Finally, she had made the break.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting a business,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling it The Pat Frank Flight Department, something that the charterers and the corporates have as a matter of course, but not the owner-flown jets. I&#x2019;ll do all the paperwork, keep the maintenance schedule, update the logbooks weekly, et cetera, et cetera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could use a service like that,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;My secretary has been doing all the work, but since she knows nothing about airplanes, it&#x2019;s hard for her. You&#x2019;re hired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great! My first client! Of course, I can&#x2019;t have dinner with you tonight, for professional reasons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fired,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess I can make an exception, your being my first client and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re rehired.&#x201d; Stone looked at the multi-function display before him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the weather the forecast predicted,&#x201d; he said, pointing at a green mass ahead of them that was dotted with yellow areas. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll fly over the bulk of it, but when we start our descent on the arrival procedure, we&#x2019;ll have to contend with it and maybe with some ice, too. And we&#x2019;ll need an instrument approach.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your airplane is equipped to deal with it,&#x201d; she reminded him.</p><p>Stone tapped an icon or two and brought up the weather at Teterboro. &#x201c;Six-hundred-foot ceiling, six miles of visibility, wind 040 at twelve, gusting twenty,&#x201d; he read. &#x201c;No problem. We&#x2019;ll keep an eye on it, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was some light snow in the forecast, too,&#x201d; Pat said.</p><p>They entered into the arrival procedure, a loop to the north, then back to the south, that the air traffic controllers used to line up and keep distance between the conga line of airplanes that would be landing at TEB. ATC gave them a lower altitude, and Stone turned on the ice prevention systems that heated the leading edges of the wings and tail and the windshield. Five minutes later they were in Instrument Meteorological Conditions and blind, except for their instruments. They continued their descent on the arrival, and at the end of it they were vectored to the Instrument Landing System for runway 6 at Teterboro. ATIS told them that the weather had deteriorated to three hundred feet and two miles of visibility, with blowing snow.</p><p>Once established on the ILS, Stone watched the indicator for the glide slope and put down the landing gear. The three green lights that indicated that the tricycle gears were down did not come on. &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; he said, then recycled the gear switch. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;re going to have to blow the gear down.&#x201d; There was a tank of nitrogen aboard that could be used to force the gear down in the event of a hydraulic failure.</p><p>Pat reached forward and twisted the knob that selected night or day flying to &#x201c;day,&#x201d; and the three green gear lights appeared. &#x201c;Some ass turned it to &#x2018;night,&#x2019;&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And the daylight washed out the dimmed lights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a relief,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>She read out the landing checklist, and the autopilot flew them down the glide slope; all Stone had to do was control the airspeed. At three hundred feet they broke out of the clouds, into light snow, and the runway lay directly ahead of them. At 160 feet, Stone turned off the autopilot and landed the airplane smoothly by hand.</p><p>&#x201c;And your first landing is a greaser!&#x201d; Pat said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just passed your insurance check ride!&#x201d;</p><p>Stone called ground control, requested taxi to Jet Aviation, where he kept the airplane, and was given the route. Five minutes later Pat was reading the shutdown checklist, and he was shutting down the engines and switching everything off.

Stone went to the rear luggage compartment, switched off the battery to conserve power, and handed a lineman the engine and pitot covers for installation. He locked up and went to the forward luggage compartment, removed his and Pat&#x2019;s bags, and handed them to another lineman, who put them onto a cart.</p><p>&#x201c;Put her in the barn,&#x201d; Stone said to the other lineman, then he and Pat followed their luggage through the Jet Aviation terminal and out to where Stone&#x2019;s factotum, Fred, waited with the Bentley.</p><p>&#x201c;Good flight, sir?&#x201d; Fred asked.</p><p>&#x201c;A great one, Fred. This is Pat Frank.&#x201d;</p><p>Fred tipped an imaginary cap, and they got into the car.</p><p>Pat produced her phone. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t book a hotel for tonight,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;I have guest rooms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How kind you are!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Saves picking you up for dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>Half an hour later they were in the garage, and while Fred dealt with the luggage, they took the elevator to the third floor. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll put you in here,&#x201d; Stone said, showing her to the largest guest room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right down the hall.&#x201d; He looked at his watch: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got two hours to get gorgeous,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet in my study for a drink at seven&#x2014;it&#x2019;s on the first floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How are we dressing?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean you have more than one dress in that little bag?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The option is jeans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wear the dress.

Knob Creek.

She&#x2019;s called Viv.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In my extreme youth I was a cop, and Dino was my partner. Now I&#x2019;m a failed cop, and Dino is the police commissioner of the City of New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you fail?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got shot in the knee, and I disagreed with my betters on the handling of an important case. They used the knee as an excuse to dump me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how did you go about becoming a lawyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was already a law-school graduate. I took a cram course and passed the bar, and an old school buddy had a job waiting for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You make it sound so easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was lucky. I had inherited this house from a great-aunt, my grandmother&#x2019;s sister, and I was renovating it, doing most of the work myself. I was more than a year into the job, my savings were gone, and I was in debt to the bank and a lot of building suppliers, when I ran into my old friend Bill Eggers, of Woodman &amp; Weld. The rest, as they say, is history.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A pretty successful history,&#x201d; she said, looking around. &#x201c;The place is beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fairly successful. When my wife died I came into some money that had been made by her first husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thus, the gift of a jet to your son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thus. How do you happen to be moving into an apartment in New York tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My sister got married and moved to the suburbs. She owned an apartment and rented it, until I could clear the decks for the move. The tenant&#x2019;s lease is up tomorrow.

Sugrue sought medical help through Edgar Cayce&#x2019;s channeled readings, and went on to become both Cayce&#x2019;s biographer and a lifelong supporter.<p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The year 1910 marked a turning point in Western spirituality. It saw the deaths of some of the most luminous religious thinkers of the nineteenth century, including psychologist-seeker William James; popular medium Andrew Jackson Davis; and Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy. These three figures deeply impacted the movements in positive thinking, prayer healing, and psychical research.</p><p>Their death that year was accompanied by the rise to prominence of a new religious innovator&#x2014;a figure who built upon the spiritual experiments of the nineteenth century to shape the New Age culture of the dawning era.* In autumn of 1910, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> brought the first major national attention to the name of Edgar Cayce, a young man who later became known as the &#x201c;father of holistic medicine&#x201d; and the founding voice of alternative spirituality.</p><p>The Sunday <i>Times</i> of October 9, 1910, profiled the Christian mystic and medical clairvoyant in an extensive article and photo spread: <i>Illiterate Man Becomes a Doctor When Hypnotized. </i>At the time, Cayce (pronounced &#x201c;Casey&#x201d;), then thirty-three, was struggling to make his way as a commercial photographer in his hometown of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, while delivering daily trance-based medical &#x201c;readings&#x201d; in which he would diagnose and prescribe natural cures for the illnesses of people he had never met.</p><p>Cayce&#x2019;s method was to recline on a sofa or daybed; loosen his tie, belt, cuffs, and shoelaces; and enter a sleeplike trance; then, given only the name and location of a subject, the &#x201c;sleeping prophet&#x201d; was said to gain insight into the person&#x2019;s body and psychology. By the time of his death in January 1945, Cayce had amassed a record of more than 14,300 clairvoyant readings for people across the nation, with many of the sessions captured by stenographer Gladys Davis.</p><p>In the 1920s, Cayce&#x2019;s trance readings expanded beyond medicine (which nonetheless remained at the core of his work) to include &#x201c;life readings,&#x201d; in which he explored a person&#x2019;s inner conflicts and needs. In these sessions, Cayce employed references to astrology, karma, reincarnation, and number symbolism. Other times, he expounded on global prophecies, climate or geological changes, and the lost history of mythical cultures, such as Atlantis and Lemuria. Cayce had no recollection of any of this when he awoke, though as a devout Christian the esotericism of such material made him wince when he read the transcripts.</p><p>Contrary to news coverage, Cayce was not illiterate, but neither was he well educated. Although he taught Sunday school at his Disciples of Christ church&#x2014;and read through the King James Bible at least once every year&#x2014;he had never made it past the eighth grade of a rural schoolhouse. While his knowledge of Scripture was encyclopedic, Cayce&#x2019;s reading tastes were otherwise limited. Aside from spending a few on-and-off years in Texas, unsuccessfully trying to use his psychical abilities to strike oil&#x2014;he had hoped to raise money to open a hospital based on his clairvoyant cures&#x2014;Cayce rarely ventured beyond the Bible Belt environs of his childhood.</p><p>Since the tale of Jonah fleeing from the word of God, prophets have been characterized as reluctant, ordinary folk plucked from reasonably satisfying lives to embark on missions that they never originally sought. In this sense, if the impending New Age&#x2014;the vast culture of Eastern, esoteric, and therapeutic spirituality that exploded on the national scene in the 1960s and 1970s&#x2014;was seeking a founding prophet, Cayce could hardly be viewed as an unusual choice, but, historically, as a perfect one.</p><p>A SEER IN SEASON</p><p>It was this Edgar Cayce&#x2014;an everyday man, dedicated Christian, and uneasy mystic&#x2014;whom New England college student and future biographer Thomas Sugrue encountered in 1927. When Sugrue met Cayce, the twenty-year-old journalism student was not someone who frequented psychics or s�ance parlors. Sugrue was a dedicated Catholic who had considered joining the priesthood. Deeply versed in world affairs and possessed of an iron determination to break into news reporting, Sugrue left his native Connecticut in 1926 for Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, which was then one of the only schools in the nation to offer a journalism degree to undergraduates. (Sugrue later switched his major to English literature, in which he earned both bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees in four years.)</p><p>As a student, Sugrue rolled his eyes at paranormal claims or talk of ESP. Yet Sugrue met a new friend at Washington and Lee who challenged his preconceptions: the psychic&#x2019;s eldest son, Hugh Lynn Cayce. Hugh Lynn had planned to attend Columbia but his father&#x2019;s clairvoyant readings directed him instead to the old-line Virginia school. (The institution counted George Washington as an early benefactor.) Sugrue grew intrigued by his new friend&#x2019;s stories about his father&#x2014;in particular the elder Cayce&#x2019;s theory that one person&#x2019;s subconscious mind could communicate with another&#x2019;s. The two freshmen enjoyed sparring intellectually and soon became roommates. While still cautious, Sugrue wanted to meet the agrarian seer.</p><p>Edgar and his wife, Gertrude, meanwhile, were laying new roots about 250 miles east of Lexington in Virginia Beach, a location the readings had also selected. The psychic spent the remainder of his life in the Atlantic coastal town, delivering twice-daily readings and developing the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), a spiritual learning center that remains active there today.</p><p>Accompanying Hugh Lynn home in June 1927, Sugrue received a &#x201c;life reading&#x201d; from Cayce. In these psychological readings, Cayce was said to peer into a subject&#x2019;s &#x201c;past life&#x201d; incarnations and influences, analyze his character through astrology and other esoteric methods, and view his personal struggles and aptitudes. Cayce correctly identified the young writer&#x2019;s interest in the Middle East, a region from which Sugrue later issued news reports on the founding of the modern state of Israel. But it wasn&#x2019;t until Christmas of that year that Sugrue, upon receiving an intimate and uncannily accurate medical reading, became an all-out convert to Cayce&#x2019;s psychical abilities.</p><p>Sugrue went on to fulfill his aim of becoming a journalist, writing from different parts of the world for publications including the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> and <i>The American Magazine</i>. But his life remained interwoven with Cayce&#x2019;s. Stricken by debilitating arthritis in the late 1930s, Sugrue sought help through Cayce&#x2019;s medical readings. From 1939 to 1941, the ailing Sugrue lived with the Cayce family in Virginia Beach, writing and convalescing. During these years of close access to Cayce&#x2014;while struggling with painful joints and limited mobility&#x2014;Sugrue completed <i>There Is a River</i>, the sole biography written of Cayce during his lifetime. When the book appeared in 1942 it brought Cayce national attention that surpassed even the earlier <i>Times</i> coverage.</p><p>DOCUMENTING THE PROPHET</p><p>Sugrue was not Cayce&#x2019;s only enthusiast within the world of American letters. <i>There Is a River</i> broke through the skeptical wall of New York publishing thanks to a reputable editor, William Sloane, of Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, who experienced his own brush with the Cayce readings.</p><p>In 1940, Sloane agreed to consider the manuscript for <i>There Is a River</i>. He knew the biography was highly sympathetic, a fact that did not endear it to him. Sloane&#x2019;s wariness faded after Cayce&#x2019;s clairvoyant diagnosis helped one of the editor&#x2019;s children. Novelist and screenwriter Nora Ephron recounted the episode in a 1968 <i>New York Times</i> article.</p><p>&#x201c;I read it,&#x201d; Sloane told Ephron. &#x201c;Now there isn&#x2019;t any way to test a manuscript like this. So I did the only thing I could do.&#x201d; He went on:</p><p>A member of my family, one of my children, had been in great and continuing pain. We&#x2019;d been to all the doctors and dentists in the area and all the tests were negative and the pain was still there. I wrote Cayce, told him my child was in pain and would be at a certain place at such-and-such a time, and enclosed a check for $25. He wrote back that there was an infection in the jaw behind a particular tooth. So I took the child to the dentist and told him to pull the tooth. The dentist refused&#x2014;he said his professional ethics prevented him from pulling sound teeth. Finally, I told him he would have to pull it. One tooth more or less didn&#x2019;t matter, I said&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t live with the child in such pain. So he pulled the tooth and the infection was there and the pain went away. I was a little shook. I&#x2019;m the kind of man who believes in X-rays. About this time, a member of my staff who thought I was nuts to get involved with this took even more precautions in writing to Cayce than I did, and he sent her back facts about her own body only she could have known. So I published Sugrue&#x2019;s book.</p><p>Many literary journalists and historians since Sugrue have traced Cayce&#x2019;s life. Journalist and documentarian Sidney D. Kirkpatrick wrote the landmark record of Cayce in his 2000 biography <i>Edgar Cayce</i>.<i> </i>Historian K. Paul Johnson crafted a deeply balanced and meticulous scholarly analysis of Cayce with the 1998 <i>Edgar Cayce in Context</i>. And the intrepid scholar of religion Harmon Bro&#x2014;who spent nine months in Cayce&#x2019;s company toward the end of the psychic&#x2019;s life&#x2014;produced insightful studies of Cayce as a Christian mystic in his 1955 University of Chicago doctoral thesis (a groundbreaking work of modern scholarship on an occult subject) and later in the 1989 biography <i>Seer Out of Season.</i> While Harmon Bro died in 1997, his family has a long&#x2014;and still active&#x2014;literary involvement with Cayce. Bro&#x2019;s mother, Margueritte, was a pioneering female journalist in the first half of the twentieth century, who brought Cayce national attention in her 1943 profile in <i>Coronet </i>magazine: &#x201c;Miracle Man of Virginia Beach.&#x201d; Bro&#x2019;s wife, June, and daughter, Pamela, actively teach and interpret the Cayce ideas today.</p><p>There exist many other works on Cayce&#x2014;it would take several paragraphs to appreciate the best of them. But it was Sugrue, an accomplished print journalist who worked and convalesced with Cayce for several years, who fully&#x2014;and this word is chosen carefully&#x2014;captured Cayce&#x2019;s <i>goodness.</i></p><p>Sugrue&#x2019;s historical Edgar Cayce is the man who grew from being an awkward, soft-voiced adolescent to a national figure who never quite knew how to manage his fame&#x2014;and less so how to manage money, often forgoing or deferring his usual $20 fee for readings, leaving himself and his family in a perpetual state of financial precariousness. In a typical letter from 1940, Cayce replied to a blind laborer who asked about paying in installments: &#x201c;You may take care of the [fee] any way convenient to your self&#x2014;please know one is not prohibited from having a reading&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they haven&#x2019;t money. If this information is of a divine source it can&#x2019;t be sold, if it isn&#x2019;t then it isn&#x2019;t worth any thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Sugrue also captured Cayce as a figure of deep Christian faith struggling to come to terms with the occult concepts that ran through his readings beginning in the early 1920s. This material extended to numerology, astrology, crystal gazing, modern prophecies, reincarnation, karma, and the story of mythical civilizations, such as Atlantis and prehistoric Egypt. People who sought readings were intrigued and emotionally impacted by this material as much as by Cayce&#x2019;s medical diagnoses. What&#x2019;s more, in readings that dealt with spiritual and esoteric topics&#x2014;along with the more familiar readings that focused on holistic remedies, massage, meditation, and natural foods&#x2014;there began to emerge the range of subjects that formed the parameters of therapeutic New Age spirituality in the later twentieth century.</p><p>ESOTERIC PHILOSOPHER</p><p>Cayce did more than assemble a catalogue of the dawning New Age. The spiritual ideas running through his readings, combined with his own intrepid study of Scripture, supplied the basis for a universal approach to religion, which, in various ways, also spread across American culture. Sugrue captures this especially well in chapter fifteen, which recounts Cayce&#x2019;s metaphysical explorations with an Ohio printer and Theosophist named Arthur Lammers. Cayce&#x2019;s collaboration with Lammers, which began in the autumn of 1923 in Selma, Alabama, marked a turn in Cayce&#x2019;s career from medical clairvoyant to esoteric philosopher.</p><p>Licking his wounds after his failed oil ventures, Cayce had resettled his family in Selma where he planned to resume his career as a commercial photographer. He and Gertrude, who had long suffered her husband&#x2019;s absences and unsteady finances, enrolled their son Hugh Lynn, then sixteen, in Selma High School. The family, now including five-year-old Edgar Evans, settled into a new home and appeared headed for some measure of domestic normalcy. All this got upturned in September, however, when the wealthy printer Lammers arrived from Dayton. Lammers had learned of Cayce during the psychic&#x2019;s oil-prospecting days. He showed up at Cayce&#x2019;s photo studio with an intriguing proposition.</p><p>Lammers was both a hard-driving businessman and an avid seeker in Theosophy, ancient religions, and the occult. He impressed upon Cayce that the seer could use his psychical powers for more than medical diagnoses. Lammers wanted Cayce to probe the secrets of the ages: What happens after death? Is there a soul? Why are we alive? Lammers yearned to understand the meaning of the pyramids, astrology, alchemy, the &#x201c;Etheric World,&#x201d; reincarnation, and the mystery religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. He felt certain that Cayce&#x2019;s readings could part the veil shrouding the ageless wisdom.</p><p>After years of stalled progress in his personal life, Cayce was enticed by this new sense of mission. Lammers urged Cayce to return with him to Dayton, where he promised to place the Cayce family in a new home and financially care for them. Cayce agreed, and uprooted Gertrude and their younger son, Edgar Evans. Hugh Lynn remained behind with friends in Selma to finish out the school term. Lammers&#x2019;s financial promises later proved illusive and Cayce&#x2019;s Dayton years, which preceded his move to Virginia Beach, turned into a period of financial despair. Nonetheless, for Cayce, if not his loved ones, Dayton also marked a stage of unprecedented discovery.</p><p>Cayce and Lammers began their explorations at a downtown hotel on October 11, 1923. In the presence of several onlookers, Lammers arranged for Cayce to enter a trance and to give the printer an astrological reading. Whatever hesitancies the waking Cayce evinced over arcane subjects vanished while he was in his trance state. Cayce expounded on the validity of astrology even as &#x201c;the Source&#x201d;&#x2014;what Cayce called the ethereal intelligence behind his readings&#x2014;alluded to misconceptions in the Western model. Toward the end of the reading, Cayce almost casually tossed off that it was Lammers&#x2019;s &#x201c;third appearance on this [earthly] plane. He was once a monk.&#x201d; It was an unmistakable reference to reincarnation&#x2014;just the type of insight Lammers had been seeking.</p><p>In the weeks ahead, the men continued their readings, probing into Hermetic and esoteric spirituality.

The increase in these violent crimes over the past decade has created an urgent need for more and better information about these men: their crime scene patterns, violent acts, and above all, their motivations for committing these shocking and repetitive murders.<br><br>This authoritative book represents the data, findings, and implications of a long-term F.B.I.-sponsored study of serial sex killers. Specially trained F.B.I. agents examined thirty-six convicted, incarcerated sexual murderers to build a valuable new bank of information which reveals the world of the serial sexual killer in both quantitative and qualitative detail. Data was obtained from official psychiatric and criminal records, court transcripts, and prison reports, as well as from extensive interviews with the offenders themselves.<br><br>Featured in this book is detailed information on the F.B.I.'s recently developed Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) and a sample of an actual VICAP Crime Analysis Report Form.</p><p>John E. Douglas is a former FBI special agent, the Bureau&#x2019;s criminal profiling pioneer and one of the creators of the <i>Crime Classification Manual</i>. He is currently a consultant on criminal investigative analysis and the author, with Mark Olshaker, of <i>Journey Into Darkness</i>, <i>The Anatomy of Motive</i>, <i>The Cases That Haunt Us</i>, and <i>Law &amp; Disorder</i>, among others.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>The Study of Murder</b><br><br>Interpersonal violence spans a wide range of human behaviors of which murder represents one of the terminal disruptions in the equilibrium of a society. Sexual homicide, a crime of increasing concern in our society, is the killing of a person in the context of power, sexuality, and brutality. Such crimes often receive widespread publicity, and they create a great deal of fear because of their apparent random and motiveless nature. Particularly in cases of serial sexual homicide, law enforcement officials feel public pressure to apprehend the perpetrator as quickly as possible.<br><br>Apprehension of the sexual murderer is one of law enforcement's most difficult challenges. Because sexual killings often appear motiveless and random, they offer few clues about why the murder occurred or, consequently, about the identity of the murderer. Even the sexual nature of these murders is not always immediately obvious, for conventional evidence of a sexual crime may be absent from a crime scene.<br><br><b>The Scope of the Problem</b><br><br>The number of sexual homicides occurring in a given year is difficult to assess, partially because of the manner in which crimes are investigated. In obvious cases of sexual assault and murder, the crime most often is reported as a homicide, not as a rape assault (Brownmiller 1975; MacDonald 1971). In other cases, conclusive evidence of sexual assault may be inadequate or lacking (Groth and Burgess 1977). Investigators may not recognize the underlying sexual dynamics of what appear to be either ordinary or motiveless murders (Cormier and Simons 1969; Revitch 1965). In addition, investigators often fail to share their findings, limiting the collective pool of knowledge on the subject (Ressler et al. 1980).<br><br>The difficulty in determining the scope of the problem of sexual homicide is reflected in official reports on murder. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) publication, <i>Crime in the United States,</i> presents statistics for crimes committed in the United States within a given year. For example, a survey of the statistics in the UCR for all murders committed in the period 1976 through 1986 shows that the number of murders in the United States has fluctuated from 16,605 in 1976 to a peak of 21,860 in 1980, dropping to 20,613 in 1986 <i>(Crime in the United States</i> 1986). The UCR also gives information about age, race, and sex of victims and offenders, about types of weapons used, and about situations in which killings took place. However, there is no differentiation in these official reports between homicides that included initially undetected sexual assault and those that did not.<br><br>The dearth of incidence statistics for sexual homicide promotes other approaches to evaluating this crime's magnitude. One of these approaches is to examine statistics for murders with unknown motives as indicators of the sexual homicide. Murder with unknown motive is one of five homicide categories for which the UCR annually provides data. These categories are as follows:<br><br>1. Felony murder (occurs during the commission of a felony).<br><br>2. Suspected felony murder (elements of felony are present).<br><br>3. Argument-motivated murder (noncriminally motivated).<br><br>4. Other motives or circumstances (any known motivation that is not included in previous categories).<br><br>5. Unknown motives (motive fits into none of the above categories).<br><br>Because sexual homicide so often appears random, motiveless, and with its sexual aspects obscured, some experts argue that many sexual homicides may be reported in the unknown motive category.<br><br>Figures for most categories of motives, except the unknown category, have remained relatively stable over the past decade. For example, felony-connected murders represented 17.7 percent of all murders in 1976, 17.2 percent in 1981, 18.0 percent in 1984, and 19.4 percent in 1986. The percentages for those murders placed in the "other" category are as follows: 1976, 18.6 percent; 1981, 17.1 percent; 1984, 17.6 percent, and 1986, 18.6 percent.<br><br>However, the number of murders committed for unknown motives has risen dramatically. These murders represented 8.5 percent of all murders in 1976, 17.8 percent in 1981, 22.1 percent in 1984, and 22.5 percent in 1986. This trend is of particular interest in the study of sexual homicide. Opinion has varied on the importance of this problem. Sociologists Wolfgang and Ferracuti proposed that the vast majority of murders are committed for a specific reason and that "probably less than 5 percent of all known killings are premeditated, planned, and intentional" (1982, 189). On the other hand, in a 1969 article psychiatrists Cormier and Simons cite studies observing that dangerous sexual offenses are both rare phenomena and nonescalating in aggression; in contrast, their data suggest that sexual murderers may be more common than we wish to acknowledge and that they do in fact have progressively violent records. The rapid increase in the unknown motive category, while most categories have held relatively steady, is an indication that the Wolfgang and Ferracuti proposition, first noted in 1967, may no longer be valid. Reporting methods for the unknown motive category have remained constant since 1976 and thus do not account for the dramatic increase in motiveless murder.<br><br>Although the incidence of sexual homicide may be difficult to ascertain, its effects are less unclear. Many sexual homicides are difficult to solve precisely because of the lack of clues. Law enforcement investigators note that solution rates may be misleading and should be scrutinized closely, since some crimes reported as unsolved are, in fact, solved after the figures have been reported. It is the belief of both investigators and clinicians that the majority of serial murders are sexual in nature (Lunde 1976; Ressler et al. 1985; Revitch 1965).<br><br>Veteran investigators say that sexual homicide is not a new phenomenon, although its apparent increase is. Public awareness of the problem has also increased, largely because of news media attention to these often bizarre, sensational crimes. People fear these crimes precisely because of the seemingly random nature of the murders.<br><br><b>Studies of Murder</b><br><br>Because of society's view of murder as both abhorrent and pervasive, the many aspects of murder have been studied by various disciplines. Law enforcement, the newcomer to the research arena, has added over the past decade its growing expertise in crime scene analysis.<br><br>Studies of murder have offered different perspectives on this violent crime. Epidemiological studies report on demographic data concerning victims and perpetrators (Constantino et al. 1977) and patterns of homicide (Rushforth et al. 1977; Wolfgang 1958). All disciplines have tried to categorize murderers. They have been typed in terms of motive (Revitch 1965), intent (Kahn 1971), number of victims (Frazier 1974), and type of victim (Cormier and Simons 1969). However, the majority of studies do not specifically address sexual homicide but rather study murder without differentiating between sexual and nonsexual crimes (Perdue and Lester 1974).<br><br>Studies examining murder divide into the various disciplines focusing on the subject: (1) individual case reports by journalists, (2) studies of the psychological aspects of the individual who committed the murder, (3) studies investigating murder and murderers within a sociological context, (4) legal aspects of the crime, and (5) crime scene patterns.<br><br><i>The Journalist's Perspective</i><br><br>The first category represents a mass communication mechanism for informing the public of crimes being committed. As such, the possible mechanisms include newspapers, magazines, and books. The writers are usually journalists, and on occasion they may have additional training like Joseph Wambaugh, formerly a police detective, who wrote <i>The Onion Field,</i> which depicts the murder of a police officer.<br><br>The news of a murder in general and a sexual homicide in particular arouses strong emotion in the public. Newspaper headlines highlight the bizarre aspects ("Body-hack Case," "Vampire Killer's Trial Begins"), the victim ("The Victim's Last Hours"), the serial aspect ("Killer Strikes Again"), the outcome ("Next Stop: The Electric Chair") and the twenty-year anniversary ("July 14, 1966").<br><br>Detective magazines are another mechanism for communication and often contain the facts learned at trial or during a journalist's investigation. In addition, journalists (Keyes 1976), as well as mental health professionals (Brussel 1968; Schreiber 1983), write books aimed at the general population.<br><br><i>The Psychological View</i><br><br>The second category includes studies that examine the individual murderer in terms of psychiatric diagnoses, childhood antecedents to criminal behavior, and criminal behavior as the result of learned responses to particular stimuli. Also in this category are studies designed to determine techniques for treating incarcerated violent offenders.<br><br>Study focus on the characteristics of individual murderers was evident as many as two hundred years ago. In the late eighteenth century, Swiss mystic Johann Kaspar Lavatar developed the art of physiognomy, whereby an individual's facial features were held to reveal his or her character. At about the same time, Franz Josef Gall contended that phrenology, the study of the formation of an individual's skull, could disclose both character and mental capacities. Physiognomy and phrenology were both used to study criminals, and death masks of murderers' heads were examined in an attempt to explain criminal acts (Attick 1970).<br><br>Among more recent theories that seek to explain violent human behavior through examination of individual physical characteristics is the approach based on the finding that certain violent criminals have a rare chromosomal abnormality called XYY (Jacobs, Brunton, and Melville 1965). According to this theory, the presence of an extra male, or Y, chromosome results in a greater likelihood that the individual will engage in aggressive and violent behavior. This idea received a great deal of attention in 1968, when it was reported that Richard Speck, the man who one night murdered eight student nurses, had the XYY abnormality. It was later found that Speck did not have the extra Y chromosome. Subsequent research demonstrated that although the XYY abnormality is four times more likely to show up in the male criminal population than in the general male population, most individuals with this condition display no abnormally violent behavior (Bootzin and Acocella 1980).<br><br>In the last decade, the field of psychiatry has paid increasing attention to brain function in all types of psychological problems. Neurological, genetic, and biophysiological components are being studied in the murderer (Lewis et al. 1986; Morrison 1981).ar<br><br>Psychological theories and explanations of violent behavior are substantially more common than those based on physical characteristics. As do studies based on individual physical attributes, these psychological studies focus on the characteristics of the individual murderer. According to Bootzin and Acocella (1980), psychological theories can be categorized as having either (1) a psychodynamic perspective (that unconscious childhood conflicts give rise to abnormal behavior), (2) a behavioral perspective (that inappropriate conditioning results in abnormal behavior), or (3) a humanistic-existential perspective (that abnormal behavior), results from a sense of personal failure).<br><br>Although individual-focused studies of violent behavior may be widely divergent in terms of their theoretical bases, they often have one thing in common: they group individuals into various categories. By producing taxonomic schemes to aid in understanding the causes of human violence, researchers seek to clarify methods of treating violent individuals and eliminating violent behavior.<br><br>Among recent general studies of human violence, several propose typologies having many categories. For example, Wille (1974) groups murderers into ten types: (1) depressives, (2) psychotics, (3) murderers with organic brain dysfunction, (4) psychopaths, (5) passive-aggressive individuals, (6) alcoholics, (7) hysterical personalities, (8) child killers, (9) mentally retarded murderers, and (10) murderers who kill for sexual satisfaction. In contrast, Guttmacher (1973) suggests six categories of murderers: (1) "average" murderers free from prominent psychopathology but lacking societal values, (2) sociopaths desiring revenge on the population at large for maltreatment during childhood, (3) alcoholics who kill their wives over fear of losing them, (4) murderers avenging a lover's loss of interest, (5) schizophrenics responding to hallucinations and delusions, and (6) sadists who kill to achieve sexual pleasure.<br><br>Other researchers have suggested fewer types of murderers. Megargee (1966) claims that there are only two types of extremely assaultive individuals (1) undercontrolled persons, who respond with aggression when frustrated or provoked, and (2) overcontrolled persons, who, despite rigid inhibitions against the expression of violence, build up an aggression that eventually results in violence. Simon (1977) studied thirty murderers and classified them into three groups: type A murderers had a tendency to murder impulsively, often with a weapon present and under the influence of alcohol. Type B murderers were more likely to be involved in a victim-induced homicide, with the victim usually a woman with whom the murderer had formed a relationship. Type AB murderers were able to sustain enduring, though sadistic, relationships with their victims and posed the greatest risk of future homicidal acts. Tanay (1972) has classified homicidal behavior into three categories: (1) ego-syntonic homicide, compatible with the offender's thinking and fulfills a consciously acceptable wish for the perpetrator; (2) ego-dystonic homicide, noncompatible with the offender's thinking and occurs against the conscious wishes of the perpetrator (who is in an altered state of consciousness); and (3) psychotic homicide, which occurs while the murderer is in a delusional state.<br><br>The few studies that specifically address sexual homicide suggest the existence of two types of sex murderers: the rape or displaced anger murderer (Cohen et al. 1971; Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom, 1977; Prentky, Burgess, and Carter 1986; Rada 1978), and the sadistic, or lust, murderer (Becker and Abel 1978; Bromberg and Coyle 1974; Cohen et al. 1971; Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom 1977; Guttmacher and Weihofen 1952; Podolsky 1966; Prentky, Burgess, and Carter 1986; Rada 1978; Ressler 1985; and Scully and Marolla 1985). Podolsky notes that rapists who murder kill after raping their victims, primarily to escape detection. These murderers, according to Rada, rarely report sexual satisfaction from their murders or perform postmortem sexual acts with their victims. In contrast, the sadistic murderer kills as part of a ritualized, sadistic fantasy (Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom 1977). For this murderer, aggression and sexuality become fused into a single psychological experience -- sadism -- in which aggression is eroticized. According to Brittain (1970), subjugation of the victim is of importance to this type of sexual killer; cruelty and infliction of pain are merely the means to effect subjugation.<br><br>The various systems for classifying murderers have themselves been categorized. According to Athens (1980), the first system type assumes there is a uniformity, or pattern, to the characteristics of a particular violent crime. In theory, once such a pattern is discovered it will rev...</p><h2>Passion on Park Avenue (Central Park Pact, The)</h2><p><b>An Oprah.com Best Romance Novel of 2019!</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Perfect for readers who love the dishy women's fiction of Candace Bushnell.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br> <br><b>From the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Stiletto and Oxford series, the first in a sizzling new series following the unlikely friendship of three Upper East Side women as they struggle to achieve their dreams and find true love and happiness in the city that never sleeps. </b><br><br>For as long as she can remember, Bronx-born Naomi Powell has had one goal: to prove her worth among the Upper East Side elite&#x2014;the same people for which her mom worked as a housekeeper.

She is based in New York City.Passion on Park Avenue <br> <br> <br>SATURDAY, JULY 21<br> <br>Naomi Powell figured there was no good way to discover that the man you&#x2019;d been dating for three months was married to someone else. But of all the possibilities, learning about the existence of a Mrs. Brayden Hayes via the cheating bastard&#x2019;s obituary?<br> <br>Definitely the worst.<br> <br>The taxi pulled to a stop outside Central Presbyterian, and Naomi nearly lost her nerve, her instincts screaming for her to tell the cabbie to take her back to the Lower East Side.<br> <br>Instead, she handed the driver a twenty, shoved open the door, and stepped onto ritzy Park Avenue as though she belonged there. She pulled her Gucci sunglasses out of her bag and slid them onto her nose&#x2014;the overcast July day didn&#x2019;t quite warrant the shades, but she was walking into a funeral. People would hopefully think the purpose of the sunglasses was to hide red, puffy eyes rather than what it really was:<br> <br>A disguise.<br> <br>Screw that, Naomi thought furiously, pushing the sunglasses back up into her dark red hair and marching with purpose toward the stately Gothic-style church. She didn&#x2019;t need a disguise. At twenty-nine, Naomi had spent most of her lifetime dealing with people trying to make her feel inferior, and she&#x2019;d be damned if she let a turd of a playboy succeed from beyond the grave.<br> <br>She had just as much right to be here as anyone else. It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;d known he was married. She hadn&#x2019;t even known he lived in Manhattan. Naomi wasn&#x2019;t sure she knew a single damn thing about the real Brayden Hayes, but even around all her anger, she still wanted the chance to say goodbye.<br> <br>The man had made her life better, for a while at least. Even if he was making it a hell of a lot worse now.<br> <br>She sighed and slid the sunglasses back onto her face. Not to protect herself, but to protect Brayden&#x2019;s wife. Naomi had no idea if Claire knew of her existence, but on the off chance she did, Naomi didn&#x2019;t want to make this any harder on the woman than it already was.<br> <br>Naomi walked up the steps to the church as Brayden&#x2019;s obituary rattled around in her brain, the way it had for days. The victim of a tragic yachting accident, Brayden Hayes is survived by wife, Claire Hayes . . .<br> <br>A yachting accident. Really? Really?<br> <br>Wasn&#x2019;t death by luxury boat just a little too good for a womanizer with the morals of a lump of coal?<br> <br>The only saving grace of the situation, and Naomi had had to look really hard to find one, was that Claire and Brayden hadn&#x2019;t had any children. Thank God for that. It was the only thing that had kept Naomi from breaking completely when she&#x2019;d learned of Brayden&#x2019;s double life. She knew all too well the havoc a philandering asshole could wreak on a child&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>Naomi stepped into the dark, quiet church and walked toward one of the back pews. Several people turned and looked her way, and her footsteps faltered.<br> <br>On a rational level, Naomi knew they were merely turning instinctively at the sharp click of her Louboutin stilettos against the church floor. Some maybe even recognized her as the Naomi Powell from the latest 30-under-30 list, or from her interview on the Today show.<br> <br>But everywhere she looked, Naomi saw only disdain. As though they could see beyond the conservative Chlo� dress to her Bronx roots. As though they knew she was the other woman. The very identity that had destroyed her mother and that Naomi had sworn to avoid.<br> <br>She sucked in a breath, trying to gather the defiance that had turned her from a nobody into one of the city&#x2019;s wealthiest women. She tried to gather the confidence that had earned her a spot on every &#x201c;women to watch&#x201d; list in the nation. But today, she didn&#x2019;t feel like a bright up-and-comer in the business world. Today she felt small. Worse, she felt dirty.<br> <br>Naomi watched as a woman pursed her lips and turned away, as though unable to look any longer upon Brayden Hayes&#x2019;s whore. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d made her. A lifetime of trying to avoid her mother&#x2019;s footsteps, and one Upper East Side scumbag had turned her into her own worst nightmare.<br> <br>Naomi didn&#x2019;t even realize she&#x2019;d turned around and left the church until she felt the warm summer breeze whip at her hair. Didn&#x2019;t register what direction she was walking until she hit the eastern edge of Central Park.<br> <br>Only then did she let herself truly breathe, sucking in big lungfuls of air. But she didn&#x2019;t cry. Naomi had promised herself a long time ago she&#x2019;d never cry because of a man.<br> <br>She was hardly dressed for a stroll, but the trees and winding path calmed her as she entered the park. A welcome respite from the nearby neighborhood and all its snobbery. In Central Park, it didn&#x2019;t matter what street you lived on, what borough you came from. Central Park belonged to all New Yorkers, one glorious shared backyard.<br> <br>The park was mostly quiet. Most tourists entered at the south side, so she saw only a couple of joggers, a few elderly couples out for a walk, two moms on a stroller date, and . . .<br> <br>Naomi did a double take at the blonde sitting alone on a park bench, and her stomach dropped out. Are you kidding me with this right now, God?<br> <br>The first thing Naomi had done after the shock of reading that Brayden Hayes was freaking married was to google the crap out of his wife, desperate for an indication that the Times had been wrong about his marital status. That it was a misprint or he was divorced. The paper hadn&#x2019;t been wrong. There really was a Mrs. Brayden Hayes.<br> <br>And she, too, had chosen Central Park over Brayden&#x2019;s funeral.<br> <br>Nearly even with Claire Hayes now, and with the sunglasses still providing Naomi anonymity, she dared to sneak a look at the other woman out of the corner of her eye.<br> <br>Brayden&#x2019;s widow looked pretty much like the picture Naomi had rummaged up online: a thirty-something Upper East Side WASP. Like Naomi, she wore oversize sunglasses, the Chanel logo glinting in a stray ray of sunshine. Naomi&#x2019;s trained eye pegged the basic black sheath as St. John, and the basic black pumps Louboutins&#x2014;identical to Naomi&#x2019;s.<br> <br>But unlike Naomi, Claire had a genteel poise about her. Like she&#x2019;d never said darn, much less dropped an f-bomb. Naomi would bet serious money that Claire Hayes didn&#x2019;t eat Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese straight out of the pan when she was stressed and that Claire had never been so poor that she&#x2019;d actually once considered taking home a neighbor&#x2019;s discarded mattress, bedbugs be damned, simply because it was free.<br> <br>Claire&#x2019;s placid expression betrayed nothing as Naomi passed her, the glasses too large to reveal any emotion on her face. For that matter, Naomi wondered if women like her experienced emotion at all. It didn&#x2019;t seem it. The woman was the picture of calm, except for . . .<br> <br>Her hands.<br> <br>Brayden&#x2019;s widow&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in her lap, the fingers of her right hand white-knuckled around the fist of her left hand. But it wasn&#x2019;t the subdued pink manicure that captured Naomi&#x2019;s attention. It was the bright red crescent moons beneath the nails.<br> <br>Naomi had a lifelong bad habit of acting before thinking, and she did so now, crossing to the other woman and sitting beside her on the park bench.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough now,&#x201d; Naomi said, using her CEO voice, calm and commanding.<br> <br>Claire didn&#x2019;t move. Naomi wasn&#x2019;t even sure the other woman heard her.<br> <br>Naomi hesitated only for a moment before slowly reaching over and prying the nails of Claire&#x2019;s right hand away from her left hand. Little streaks of blood were left in the wake.<br> <br>Claire looked down in confusion, as though just now registering the pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does that Givenchy have any Kleenex?&#x201d; Naomi asked, nodding toward Claire&#x2019;s clutch on the bench.<br> <br>Claire didn&#x2019;t move for a long moment, then taking a deep breath, she calmly reached for her purse, pulling out a travel-size package of tissue.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re wearing the same shoes. Same dress, too,&#x201d; Claire said, dabbing at the blood on the back of her hand with a tissue, using the same casual indifference of one dabbing up a drop of spilled water.<br> <br>Naomi nodded in agreement, though Claire&#x2019;s St. John was a knee-length mock turtleneck, and Naomi&#x2019;s Chlo� was a boatneck that hit at midthigh.<br> <br>For a long moment, neither said anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to be at a funeral,&#x201d; Claire said, balling up the tissue and dropping her hands back into her lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Naomi was genuinely curious. She knew why she wasn&#x2019;t at that funeral. But the widow being a no-show . . . that was some serious Page Six&#x2013;worthy gossip right there.<br> <br>Claire opened her mouth to respond but shut it when a pretty young woman with dark brown hair walked past them. Naomi waited for the other woman to pass and, when she gave the brunette a closer look, realized the other woman was walking a bit too slowly, as though tempted to approach. She looked vaguely familiar. Naomi was fairly sure they&#x2019;d crossed paths at a couple of events, though Naomi couldn&#x2019;t put a name with the face.<br> <br>Brayden&#x2019;s widow, however, could. Claire went rigid beside Naomi, even as she called out to the other woman, &#x201c;Audrey.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unlike Claire and Naomi, the brunette wasn&#x2019;t wearing sunglasses, and Naomi saw her round eyes go even wider. &#x201c;You know who I am?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Audrey Tate. I did a little digging after you called the house that night,&#x201d; Claire said quietly. &#x201c;I know you were sleeping with my husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>Naomi&#x2019;s head whipped around in surprise, and then surprise escalated to shock as she realized Claire wasn&#x2019;t talking to her.<br> <br>What the . . .<br> <br>Audrey let out a hiccuping sob and walked to the bench, and Naomi almost laughed when she saw the other woman&#x2019;s shoes. Black Louboutin pumps identical to hers and Claire&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Audrey was saying in a rush as she sat beside Claire and stared at her with a pleading expression. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know until you picked up the phone that night that he was married. I swear to you, he told me his wife had left him, that he was separated . . . I never would have&#x2014; You have to believe me. I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, honey,&#x201d; Naomi interrupted, half-sympathetic, half-horrified. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to get it together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Audrey stopped her sniffling and gave Naomi what she probably thought was an icy glare, but the impact was diminished by the red nose and puffy eyes. &#x201c;Respectfully, you don&#x2019;t know the first thing about what&#x2019;s going on here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well now, that&#x2019;s the thing,&#x201d; Naomi said, looking down at her manicure. &#x201c;I sort of do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both women were studying her now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Claire asked.<br> <br>Naomi studied the other woman for only a moment before acting on the same instinct that had taken her from Bronx high school dropout to entrepreneurial superstar; she sensed that Claire Hayes was the sort of woman who deserved the truth. The full truth.<br> <br>Naomi pushed her sunglasses on top of her head and looked at Claire. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Naomi Powell. The other other woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Audrey&#x2019;s mouth fell open, but Claire didn&#x2019;t react beyond a slightly too long blink. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn. She&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d been pretty clear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your husband was putting his pickle into one too many sandwiches,&#x201d; Naomi announced plainly. &#x201c;Well, two too many if you count her.&#x201d; She jerked her chin toward Audrey.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you just compare . . . pickle . . . oh my God, sandwiches,&#x201d; Audrey said, lifting a hand to her forehead.<br> <br>Claire&#x2019;s head dropped forward, her chin resting on her chest, and Naomi winced. Perhaps she could have phrased it slightly differently . . . sticking his noodle in the wrong casserole? Cucumber into multiple salads?<br> <br>But Claire Hayes surprised her. Her shoulders were shaking, not with tears but with silent amusement. Then she tossed her head back and looked at the sky, letting out an audible laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate to be the one to tell you this,&#x201d; Audrey told Claire, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s up there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now it was Naomi&#x2019;s turn to let out a surprised laugh as she realized she&#x2019;d underestimated the brunette. She may look like a lanky Hepburn, but this Audrey had an edge beneath the sweet, doe-eyed appearance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we be at the funeral?&#x201d; Claire asked. Probably more to herself, but Naomi answered anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah. I mostly showed up to tell God not to allow that one through the pearly gates, and as Audrey pointed out, I think He probably already figured that one out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d be here,&#x201d; Claire said tiredly, lifting her fingers to her temples and rubbing absently.<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean sitting on a park bench with your husband&#x2019;s mistresses while his funeral goes down just a couple blocks over?&#x201d; Naomi asked.<br> <br>Claire laughed. &#x201c;Yes. That. I just keep thinking I know I should be sad, but instead all I can think about is how stupid I was, and that&#x2019;s before I knew there were two of you. How did I not see it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were just as stupid,&#x201d; Audrey said, setting a hand on Claire&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;He was my boyfriend for a year. I just thought he traveled a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three months,&#x201d; Naomi said, pointing at herself. &#x201c;He told me most of his business dealings were in Hong Kong and that he had to work most nights. I totally bought it.&#x201d;<br> <br>They all fell silent, lost in their own memories of the man, and Naomi was struck that despite the fact that this was perhaps one of the weirdest meetings in the history of female encounters, it didn&#x2019;t feel as odd as it should. Far from resenting the other women, she felt almost comforted by their presence. Claire&#x2019;s and Audrey&#x2019;s very existence was proof that Naomi wasn&#x2019;t the only clueless one. That she wasn&#x2019;t alone in being a victim of a heartless man&#x2019;s games.<br> <br>Who would have thought that strength in numbers applied to a dead man&#x2019;s philandering?<br> <br>Naomi straightened slightly and turned toward the others. &#x201c;I have a confession.&#x201d;<br> <br>Claire lifted her eyebrows. &#x201c;Worse than the fact that you were having adult sleepovers with my husband?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who I didn&#x2019;t know was your husband,&#x201d; Naomi clarified, waving her finger at Claire. &#x201c;But no, my confession is that while I&#x2019;m really mad at Brayden, I&#x2019;m even angrier at myself. For letting him fool me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Audrey nodded. &#x201c;Same. I mean, it&#x2019;s a little more self-loathing than anger, I guess, but . . . I just can&#x2019;t stop thinking about how I didn&#x2019;t see it. And if I didn&#x2019;t see him being a snake, how will I ever spot another man being a snake?&#x201d;<br> <br>Claire looked down at her hands, running the pad of her finger along the small cuts caused by her own manicured fingers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried about it. After all this, I&#x2019;m pretty dead set on turning into the old lonely lady with cats.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Naomi said firmly. &#x201c;We are not going to let him do that to us. I&#x2019;m not really a long-term relationship girl, but I do like a male companion, and I have no intention of letting Brayden sour me on . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pickles?&#x201d; Audrey suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to say sex, but yeah. That, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Audrey&#x2019;s smile was fleeting. &#x201c;But I am the long-term relationship girl. I want the ring and the babies, and the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t say white picket fence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh God no.&#x201d; Audrey shuddered, then pointed to her shoes. &#x201c;These red soles are meant for Fifth Ave, not the burbs. But I still want the fairy tale, and I just . . .&#x201d; She swallowed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s harder to believe these days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So let me get this straight.&#x201d; Naomi turned to Claire. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re go...</p><h2>The Big Book of Classic Fantasy</h2><p><b>Unearth the enchanting origins of fantasy fiction with a collection of tales as vast as the tallest tower and as mysterious as the dark depths of the forest. <br></b><br> Fantasy stories have always been with us.

Her experiences are a must-read for anyone who loves the untamed nature and wondrous beauty of Maine&#39;s north woods and the unique spirit of those who lived there. In the 1930s, in spite of being warned that remote Churchill Depot was no place for a woman, the remarkable Helen Hamlin set off at age twenty to teach school at the isolated lumber camp at the headwaters of the Allagash River. She eventually married a game warden and moved deeper into the wilderness. In her book, Hamlin captures that time in her life, complete with the trappers, foresters, lumbermen, woods folk, wild animals, and natural splendor that she found at Umsaskis Lake and then at Nine Mile Bridge on the St. John River.</p><p>Helen Hamlin was born in 1917 and was raised in the Northern Aroostook County town of Fort Kent, Maine. Growing up in a family of game wardens, she had a deep appreciation and love of both the culture of the North Woods and its inspirational beauty. It was a love affair that lasted her entire life. After teaching school in a remote lumber camp and living deep in the Maine wilderness as the wife of a fish and game warden, Hamlin went on to run the Parmachenee Club, worked as a portrait painter, wrote a best-selling book, served as a French translator in Africa, and traveled the world. She died in 2004.Helen Hamlin&#39;s descriptions vividly illuminate images of a vast, remote, lonely and heavily forested land of timber and wildlife on which a rugged, hardworking culture depended for its survival. Her book records in human terms details of life in our northern forest that would otherwise fade from our collective memory and be lost forever. --Dean B. Bennett, Author of The Wilderness from Chamberlain Farm</p><h2>The Compassionate Mind Workbook: A step-by-step guide to developing your compassionate self</h2><p><p>There is good and increasing evidence that cultivating compassion for one's self and others can have a profound impact on our physiological, psychological and social processes. In contrast, concerns with inferiority, shame and self-criticism can have very negative impacts on these processes and are associated with poorer physical and mental health. </p><p><i>The Compassionate Mind Workbook</i> is for anyone who is interested in how compassion - in the form of ideas and practices derived from Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) and other approaches - may help us to engage with, understand and ultimately, try to alleviate suffering. </p><p>CFT utilises both Buddhist practices and Western psychological science. It draws on neuroscience, insights into emotion regulation and identity formation, interpersonal psychology and a range of psychotherapeutic models. CFT-based interventions can help people with a range of mental health problems develop compassion for themselves, be open to the compassion of others and develop compassion for others.</p><p>This workbook is a step-by-step guide to CFT, in which the chapters build your understanding of yourself, the skills that give rise to a compassionate mind, and ways to work with whatever difficulties you're struggling with in life. The exercises, prompts and case stories in this book provide an understandable and practical way to develop compassion.</p></p><p><p><b>Chris Irons (Author) </b><br> <b>Dr Chris Irons</b> is a clinical psychologist, researcher, author and trainer.

With the overwhelming flood of information and opinion in our times&#x2015;much of it a mixture of spin, sound bites, and trivialities&#x2015;it is crucial we turn back to the Bible and pay close attention to the deep insights that have stood the test of time.</p><p>Proverbs 1:20 tells us that &#x201c;Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice.&#x201d; The wisdom of God does not stand aloof, but instead graciously moves toward us, into the world where we live and struggle day by day&#x2015;offering us her very best, if we will only listen.</p><p>Pastor and teacher Ray Ortlund unpacks the book of Proverbs in twenty-one straightforward sermons, providing a biblical worldview on everything from money, sex, and power to that of the daily routines of an average life. Drawing relevant parallels from ancient culture to present day, he helps us understand how the book of Proverbs is practical help for ordinary people going through everyday life.</p><p>Most importantly, Ortlund shows how the Proverbs point to Jesus and his counsel for the perplexed, his strength for the defeated, his warning to the proud, his mercy for the broken. With careful treatment of the Scriptures and uncomplicated language,&nbsp;<em>Proverbs: Wisdom that Works</em>&nbsp;bridges the gap between real-life experience and the scholarly depth of many commentaries.</p><p>Part of the Preaching the Word series.</p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong> is the pastor to pastors&nbsp;at Immanuel Church in Nashville, Tennessee. He is the author of several books, including the Preaching the Word commentary on Isaiah and <em>Marriage and the Mystery of the Gospel</em>, as well as a contributor to the <em>ESV Study Bible</em>. He and his wife, Jani, have four children.</p><p>,&nbsp;Pastor to&nbsp;Pastors, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><br><br><p><strong>R.

He serves as the series editor for the Preaching the Word commentary series and is the author or coauthor of many books. He and his wife, Barbara, live in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, and have four children and an ever-increasing number of grandchildren.</p><p><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Senior Pastor Emeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;I simply cannot say enough about Ortlund&#x2019;s treatment of the book of Proverbs. There is depth here&#x2015;scholarship disguised as pastoral advice. There is breadth here&#x2015;quoting diverse people from Descartes to Sherlock Holmes. There is heart here&#x2015;the heart of an evangelist, a pastor, a friend, and one who truly understands the Word. <em>Proverbs: Wisdom that Works</em> shines God&#x2019;s light on your day in every area of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Woodrow Kroll, </strong>President, Back to the Bible; author, <em>Proverbs: God&#x2019;s Guide for Life&#x2019;s Choices</em></p><p>&#x201c;Ortlund not only speaks wisdom, he models how to speak it. He not only lights the way on how to preach Proverbs, but on how to walk in wisdom&#x2015;and he makes me want to do both! Almost immediately I had two reactions: &#x2018;Why am I not preaching Proverbs right now?&#x2019; and &#x2018;Why am I not wiser by now?&#x2019; Turn here not just to hear about wisdom, but also to taste it. You&#x2019;ll find the savor reverently worshipful, theologically rich, and relentlessly practical.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Kitchen</strong>, Senior Pastor, Stow Alliance Fellowship, Stow, Ohio; author, <em>Proverbs: A Mentor Commentary</em></p><p>&#x201c;The strength of Ray Ortlund&#x2019;s study of Proverbs is its Christ-centeredness. The wisdom of Proverbs loses none of its practical value, but rather is given its ultimate fulfillment as an expression of the wisdom of Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Proverbs: Wisdom that Works</em> models powerful, profound, relevant expository preaching. The expositions are God-centered, Christ-centered, practical, evangelistic, life-changing, and life-giving. For Proverbs 1&#x2013;9, each exposition digs deeply into the meaning of the passage in its original context, connects it with the New Testament (especially with Jesus Christ), and demonstrates astutely its contemporary relevance with illustrations and quotations. The last seven chapters bring together various proverbs under seven topics: the tongue, humility, family, emotions, friendship, money, and life and death. The oral style provides easy reading for deep, wise insights. A superb source for preachers preparing a series of Christian sermons on the book of Proverbs and for Bible study groups interested in studying biblical wisdom.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sidney Greidanus,</strong> Professor of Preaching Emeritus, Calvin Theological Seminary; author, <em>Preaching Christ from the Old Testament</em></p><p>&#x201c;For the pastor who desires to preach Proverbs, this book will prove to be an important tool. Ortlund&#x2019;s scholarly giftedness and his pastoral passions combine to create an accurate, readable, and Christ-centered guide to Solomon&#x2019;s great book of &#x2018;love and faithfulness.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>George W. Robertson</strong>, Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Augusta, Georgia; author, <em>Deuteronomy: More Grace, More Love</em></p><p>&#x201c;I have been an appreciative reader and user of R. Kent Hughes&#x2019; series of Preaching the Word. It is therefore a joy to commend the most recent addition to that series in Raymond C. Ortlund, Jr.&#x2019;s <em>Proverbs: Wisdom that Works</em>. It goes without saying that we in the evangelical Church have long needed an exposition of this book, for it really does deal with 'where the rubber meets the road' on the hard realities of living the Christian life. I enjoyed each chapter of Ray&#x2019;s exposition and with thanksgiving to our Lord commend this work to all of God&#x2019;s people&#x2015;both pastors, leaders and laypersons. It touches on the basic fabric of life with a note of divine authority and practicality.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Walter C. Kaiser Jr.,&nbsp;</strong>President Emeritus and Colman M.

Drawing on lessons learned from working with more than 15,000 small, medium-sized, and very large organisations, Gerber has discovered the truth behind why management doesn&#x2032;t work and what to do about it. Unearthing the arbitrary origins of commonly held doctrines such as the omniscience of leader (Emperor) and the most widely embraced myth of all&#x64e8;e E-Myth Manager offers a fresh, provocative alternative to management as we know it. It explores why every manager must take charge of his own life, reconcile his own personal vision with that of the organisation, and develop an entrepreneurial mind-set to achieve true success. </p></p><p><p><strong>Michael E. Gerber</strong> is a true legend of entrepreneurship. The editors of <em>INC</em> magazine called him&nbsp;"The World's #1 Small Business Guru." He is Co-founder and Chairman of the Michael E. Gerber Companies&#x2014;a group of highly unique enterprises dedicated to creating world-class start-ups and entrepreneurs in every industry and economy. The Gerber Companies transforms the way small business owners grow their enterprises and has evolved into an empire over its history of nearly three decades.</p>To become an E-Myth manager, it's essential to know what you want, to discover your "Primary Aim," asserts Gerber in this sequel to The E-Myth: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It. He spells out what he thinks is needed: the E-Myth manager should have an entrepreneurial mind-set, be committed to making choices and must exercise full accountability. Some managers, he maintains, are on autopilot. He sets forth seven steps to establish a conscious organization in which conscious people can find meaning and success. The conscious organization manifests its vision through a high sense of purpose, order, integrity and meaning. A revolution in the "idea" of management is essential, Gerber stresses, one that helps people grow beyond their perceived limitations. The underpinnings of the mind-set of E-Myth managers is to think of their company as a small business, no matter its size. E-MythAi.e., entrepreneurial mythAhas become a buzz word in the corporate world, with good reason as Gerber reaffirms here. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dust to Dust: A Novel (Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[Tami Hoag] demonstrates just why she has become one of the hottest names in the suspense game. Bottom line: Leaves competition in the dust.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Sorry.</i> The single word is written on a mirror. In front of it hangs a Minneapolis Internal Affairs cop. Was it suicide? Or a kinky act turned tragic?<br> &nbsp;<br> Either way, it wasn&#x2019;t murder.

The cloud of suspicion falls not only on the city&#x2019;s elite, but over the very heart of the police department. Someone wants the case closed&#x2014;quickly and forever. But even with their careers and their lives on the line, neither Kovac nor Liska will give up. As they unearth a connection between a two-month-old murder case and one that has been closed for twenty years, they find themselves chasing a killer who will stop at nothing to keep a dark and shattering secret.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;Without a doubt, one of the most intense suspense writers around.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Tami Hoag is the queen of the crime story.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Post</i></b></p><p>Minneapolis has more than its share of interesting cops (Lucas Davenport of the John Sandford thrillers, for one), and Tami Hoag's homicide dicks, Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska, join the club in this thoughtful and surprisingly moving novel of dirty cops and cover-ups. Internal Affairs investigator Andy Fallon is a suicide--or is he? The word around the department is that Andy, son of Iron Mike Fallon, an old hero of Sam's, killed himself because Mike turned his back on him when Andy told him he was gay. Or maybe it was because a lover dumped him, or even (snicker, snicker) a perverted sexual practice gone wrong. That's the gossip, but Sam feels he owes it to Mike to investigate. <p> Sam is a familiar type in this genre, and his self-awareness is almost painful at times. "You're a stereotype. The tragic hero," he's told by Amanda Savard, the strong-but-vulnerable Internal Affairs lieutenant whose determination to keep the Fallon case closed foreshadows her personal history. "The twice-divorced, smoking, drinking workaholic," Sam agrees. "I don't know what's heroic about that. It reeks of failure to me, but maybe I have unrealistic standards." But Sam's droll sense of humor is matched by his deeply ingrained crap detector. When Iron Mike apparently kills himself too, you can almost feel its needle vibrate. Then Sam and Nikki open another closed case, this one almost two decades old, and find the connections that threaten to unravel past crimes and future promises. Hoag is a writer very much in command of her craft: the pacing excels, the characters are complex and interesting, and the details well worked out. Readers will look forward to another Kovac and Liska adventure. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><i>New York Times</i> bestseller Tami Hoag is at the top of her form in her newest thriller, blending unforgettable characters, breakneck suspense, and chilling twists.

He doesn't want to spend any more time than he has to in the bleak, empty world of the victim's father, Iron Mike, Kovac's old mentor and a department legend.

It was a fateful day in 1244 when he met Shams Tabriz, a wild mystic with rare gifts and insight.

By examining the role of the cheesemaker throughout world history and by understanding a few basic principles of cheese science and technology, we can see how different cheeses have been shaped by and tailored to their surrounding environment, as well as defined by their social and cultural context. <em>Cheese and Culture</em> endeavors to advance our appreciation of cheese origins by viewing human history through the eyes of a cheese scientist.</p> <p>There is also a larger story to be told, a grand narrative that binds all cheeses together into a single history that started with the discovery of cheese making and that is still unfolding to this day. This book reconstructs that 9000-year story based on the often fragmentary information that we have available. <em>Cheese and Culture</em> embarks on a journey that begins in the Neolithic Age and winds its way through the ensuing centuries to the present. This tour through cheese history intersects with some of the pivotal periods in human prehistory and ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and modern history that have shaped western civilization, for these periods also shaped the lives of cheesemakers and the diverse cheeses that they developed. The book offers a useful lens through which to view our twenty-first century attitudes toward cheese that we have inherited from our past, and our attitudes about the food system more broadly.</p> <p>This refreshingly original book will appeal to anyone who loves history, food, and especially good cheese.</p></p><p><p>Paul Kindstedt is a Professor of Food Science in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont. He has authored numerous research articles and invited conference proceedings on dairy chemistry and cheese science, as well as many book chapters.

Who knew the 9,000 years of innovation, lore, history, and romance in your story? Who knew skim milk cheeses initially flourished not for diet reasons, but because they were cheaper for London&#x2019;s working-classes? That higher-temperature cooking techniques contributed to the development of dry and aged cheeses? Or that economics, religion, social mores, climate, and&#x2015;well, nearly anything&#x2015;has influenced the evolution of cheese in all its forms, styles, tastes, shapes, and uses? Paul S. Kindstedt knows, and now, through his impeccably researched, and carefully assembled book, any cheese lover can know, too.&nbsp; Kindstedt&#x2019;s is a book written with scholarly rigor; yet, that detail-laden precision also makes it palatable for foodies curious about how and why food choices, production, and tastes have emerged over centuries&#x2015;the person jazzed to learn, for example, that &#x2018;Grated cheese seems to have occupied a special place in Greek culture&#x2019; indicated by a wounded soldier being served &#x2018;an elixir consisting of Pramnian wine on which (his slave) sprinkles goat&#x2019;s-milk cheese, grated with a bronze grater,&#x2019; or that the seasonal movement of cows across south-central France inspired techniques for producing longer-lasting mountain cheeses. Like the range of cheeses available today, at times <em>Cheese and Culture</em> can be overwhelming, and the chapter on regulation reads like an alphabet soup of agency abbreviations and acronyms. But, like the veined or sharply flavored offerings on a cheese plate, one could choose to skip it and still be satiated.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em><br><br>Kindstedt (food science, Univ. of Vermont) delivers an extensively researched and comprehensive history of cheese and its place in the development of Western civilization. Beginning with the ancient origins of cheese making and moving through the classical, medieval, and Renaissance periods to the modern era, the author examines the traditional cheeses that came about during each period and how they were tailored to the environment and culture of the time. Finally, he explores the friction that has developed between the United States and the European Union over issues surrounding cheese making and trade, such as protecting traditional product names, food safety regulation, and the use of new agricultural technologies such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and hormones. VERDICT: Incorporating archaeology, religion, and literature, this detailed, accessible history will appeal to readers who enjoy food histories.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Choice-</strong></em><br><br>Cheese scientist Kindstedt (Univ. of Vermont) has written a lively history of cheese through an examination of the cultural environments from which specific types of cheese-making traditions were born and, in some cases, have continued to the present. Kindstedt begins as early as possible with archaeological evidence of early fresh cheese making in the Fertile Crescent and its role in pre-Christian religious ritual. He quickly moves on to the introduction of rennet in cheese making and cheese in Greek and Roman civilizations and incorporation into daily life, both mundane and sacred. The last half of the book concentrates on the European cheese-making tradition and the role of monasteries in the development of aged cheeses. Surprisingly, Kindstedt does not spend too much time discussing factory-made cheese and the move away from traditional cheese making. But he does end with a timely discussion on raw milk safety and multinational trade laws that impact traditional cheeses, as well as a brief discussion on the artisanal cheese movement. <em>Cheese and Culture</em> is a well-researched, concise, and valuable addition to any food history collection.

Kimberly Elam takes the reader on a geometrical journey, lending insight and coherence to the design process by exploring the visual relationships that have foundations in mathematics as well as the essential qualities of life. Geometry of Design takes a close look at a broad range of twentieth-century examples of design, architecture, and illustration (from the Barcelona chair to the paintings of Georges Seurat, from the Braun hand blender to the Conico kettle), revealing underlying geometric structures in their compositions. Explanations and techniques of visual analysis make the inherent mathematical relationships evident and a must-have for anyone involved in art, design, or architecture graphic arts. The book focuses not only on the classic systems of proportioning, such as the golden section and root rectangles, but also on less well known proportioning systems such as the Fibonacci Series. Through detailed diagrams these geometric systems are brought to life giving an effective insight into the design process.</p><p>Kimberly Elam is the head of the Graphic and Interactive Communication Design Department at the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, FL.

She explores the relationships between visual representations and their foundations in geometry. It's a great book that focuses on the golden ratio and root rectangles.

James Oles ranges widely across media and genres, offering new readings of painting, sculpture, architecture, prints, and photographs. He interprets major works by such famous artists as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, but also discusses less familiar figures in history and landscape painting, muralism, and conceptual art. <p>The story of Mexican art is set in its rich historical context by the book&#x2019;s treatment of political and social change. The author draws on recent scholarship to examine crucial issues of race, class, and gender, including the work of indigenous artists during the colonial period, and of women artists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p> Throughout, Oles shows how Mexican artists participated in local and international developments.

In &#34;Traveling Light,&#34; Eugene H. Peterson, who is translator of &#34;The Message Bible,&#34; explores the free life in Christ that we must both receive as a gift and practice as a skill. In an engaging, often passionate dialogue in which Paul&#39;s letter to the Galatians faces off against the crises of modern life, he offers both encouragement and challenge to men and women trapped in the anxieties and determinism of our age. Eugene H. Peterson was pastor of Christ Our King United Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, for nearly three decades, then served as professor of spirituality theology at Regent College, Vancouver, BC. Dr. Peterson is translator of &#34;The Message&#34; and author of numerous other works, among them &#34;A Long Obedience in the Same Direction&#34; and &#34;Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places.&#34; &#34;Like a skilled eye doctor, Eugene Peterson turns the lens that clears our vision and enables us to discriminate between reality and fantasy, to see what satisfies and what leads to bondage.&#34; -- Rebecca Pippert</p><p></p><h2>Ogre Enchanted</h2><p><p><strong>Set in the world of the Newbery Honor</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>winning <em>Ella Enchanted</em>, this tale by beloved author Gail Carson Levine stars a clever heroine who is determined to defy expectations&#x2014;and outwit a fairy&#x2019;s curse.</strong></p><p>Evie is happiest when she is healing people, diagnosing symptoms and prescribing medications, with the help of her devoted friend (and test subject) Wormy.

AND EVERY SUPERHERO has an origin story. The Hulk got hit with gamma rays, Batman became an orphan, and Spider-Man received that infamous bite from a radioactive spider. My origin story happened when I was two years old. My mother and father were arguing, a common occurrence in our cramped upstairs apartment on Albert Street in Flint, Michigan. An extension cord was plugged into the living room wall to power a nearby lamp. As they fought, I put one end of the cord in my mouth while it was still attached to the wall socket. It blew up, and I got shocked. My mother said I never made a sound. No screaming or crying, just a bloody, smoking lower lip with a hunk of skin hanging grotesquely from my chin. The cord at my feet told her what had happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Panicked I was in cardiac arrest&#x2014;or worse&#x2014;because of my eerie silence, they both rushed me off to the hospital. My mother was questioned by nurses, doctors, and even the police, as they harbored suspicions about her story, but eventually&#x2014;to her great relief&#x2014;child abuse was ruled out. A sense of gratitude accompanied the realization that it could have been much worse: I could have been electrocuted. Instead, the jolt of electricity gave me my &#x201c;superpowers&#x201d; and the scar I still have on my lower lip.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I grew up, I loved hearing about my superhero beginnings, and I asked my parents to tell me the story again and again. As they told and retold it, I sometimes imagined I&#x2019;d been electrocuted and had died in that room. I had visions of God sending angels to bring me back to life because God had determined I was special. Not only that, but I also saw God speaking as the doctors did in the opening titles of my favorite show, The Six Million Dollar Man: &#x201c;I can rebuild him. Make him stronger.&#x201d; My imagination as a child stayed on overdrive at all times and has remained just as vivid to this day.<br> &nbsp;<br> The matriarch of our family&#x2014;my wise, tough-as-nails grand-aunt, Mama Z&#x2014;put the piece of my lip in a mason jar and kept it on her mantel. Needless to say, my mother was horrified every time she saw it, as it had blackened into a tough jerky, and she was happy when Mama Z finally threw out her macabre souvenir. But for me, this family legend was just more proof that I was special. The story made me feel exceptionally tough because I&#x2019;d survived something that should have killed me. My quarter-sized keloid scar on my bottom lip has always been a reminder of my strength and survival.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was three, the arguments with my father became so unbearable that my mother moved out of our Albert Street apartment and joined Mama Z and her husband, Brother Wright, on their farm just outside Flint. My mother, my older brother, Marcelle, and I lived in their attic for a year. I loved every minute of our time there, especially running outside among the chickens, pigs, and cornstalks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mama Z talked nonstop while Brother Wright sat in the kitchen nodding yes or shaking his head no. She was an amazing cook and prepared feasts, which I devoured. My hunger embarrassed my mother, and she always told me not to ask for anything. But she also told me not to lie. And Mama Z constantly asked me if I was hungry. I looked at my mother, noticed her angry squint, but still I nodded yes. Mama Z fixed me a huge plate of meat, beans, vegetables, and potatoes, as well as peach cobbler packed with ripe peaches she&#x2019;d picked behind the house. I grinned at my mother until she reluctantly smiled back, knowing she&#x2019;d been foiled again.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother often left us alone with Mama Z, a tough cookie who worked outside every day and introduced me to how real the world could be. In the morning, she stood in her kitchen, declaring there would be chicken for dinner as Brother Wright nodded in agreement. Then she went out back by the barn and looked for a good-sized chicken. I sat on the back stoop, watching as Mama Z tiptoed around with the fowl, almost mimicking their steps.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here, chickee, chickee, chickee,&#x201d; she called out in the sweetest little-old-lady voice imaginable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she violently yanked the bird she wanted out of the crowd and held the neck still while spinning the body around in circles like a jump rope. When she let her victim go, the other chickens scattered and clucked loudly as her chicken&#x2014;its neck broken, head dangling near its feet&#x2014;ran around the yard flapping its wings for what was the longest minute of my short life. As the runaway chicken came near me, I recoiled on the stoop, scared to death it might attack me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on in the house,&#x201d; she said, waving me inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she carried in the chicken, she promptly dunked it in boiling water, then plucked, gutted, butchered, and fried it. I watched every step, determined that I was never going to eat that bird. But as time went on, I grew hungrier and hungrier, and by the time she placed that same chicken down in front of me, with white rice and corn, I ate every bite. Plus seconds. It was the best chicken I ever tasted.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a year with Mama Z, my mother and father reconciled, and we moved back in with my father. But not all reunions are happy. Before long, there were plenty of reasons I started feeling the need to be tough, even though I was only in kindergarten. We relocated to a small, ramshackle house on Flint Park Avenue. My father, Big Terry, began getting ready for the birth of my little sister, Michaell, and he and Trish, which is what we called my mother, moved Marcelle and me into the smaller of the two bedrooms.<br> &nbsp;<br> At sixteen, my mother had given birth to my brother, and then had me at eighteen. I now suspect her youth had something to do with why we never called her Mom. And I believe we didn&#x2019;t refer to Big Terry as Dad in order to make it easier on Marcelle because he wasn&#x2019;t Marcelle&#x2019;s birth father. The fact that we had different fathers was never hidden from Marcelle and me, and I often wondered what Marcelle&#x2019;s father looked like and what he was doing. I thought about how it would feel to not know or have contact with my birth father, and I was always sensitive to what it must be like for Marcelle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once Big Terry and Trish had moved us into the smaller bedroom, they stacked our beds into bunk beds, which my brother and I loved because they now earned our highest compliment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just like on TV!&#x201d; we shouted when we ran into the room and saw them for the first time. I prowled around, trying out amazing feats of strength and showing off for Marcelle. Superhero-style, I lifted dressers and the living room couch and flexed endlessly, imagining electricity still running through my body. I would take the bottom bunk because I had a bad habit of falling out of bed in my sleep. I was also a bed wetter. Until I was fourteen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking back on that time, I realize that my bed-wetting had something to do with how unsafe I sometimes felt in that house. One of the first nights my brother and I were sleeping in our new room, I woke up from a sound sleep to rumbling in the house that felt like thunder. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. I lay in the dark, trying to make sense of where I was and what was happening. The whole place was shuddering. Trish was shrieking and screaming. It was pandemonium. I&#x2019;d never heard anything like that before in our house, but nothing could have prepared me for those sounds anyhow. It felt like war.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our bedroom door was closed, but light leaked in from the other side. My father had just installed a makeshift divider between our bedroom and the living room. It was uneven and allowed light and sounds to filter through the cracks to where we lay. I heard Big Terry&#x2019;s booming footsteps and a weird shuffling sound. It felt like an earthquake was shaking everything. I thought of my favorite Godzilla movies and wondered if the house would fall down like when he destroyed a city. I was scared of what was happening, and I stayed in my bed with the covers pulled up over my head. Marcelle did, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> It became common for me to wake up to these sounds. And soon, there was a night when the chaos spilled into our room as my mother burst through the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take the boys and go,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Big Terry followed close behind her. She had left before, and he knew she was serious. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t, Trish,&#x201d; he said, his voice pleading.<br> &nbsp;<br> I blinked against the light, scared, trying not to do anything to make it worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, I&#x2019;m gonna take them,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something in Big Terry seemed to snap.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You do that, and you&#x2019;ll be sorry,&#x201d; he said, his voice growing angry.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>An Only Child and Her Sister</h2><p>AN ONLY CHILD AND HER SISTER is a compelling true life story.&nbsp; Two sisters born to the same parents but treated so differently; one ended up pregnant and married at thirteen. The other didn&#x2019;t fare so well. Casey and her little sister, Christine, started off with what looked like a good beginning. But looks can be deceiving. Their mother, Eve Whitney, a stunning Hollywood beauty, didn&#x2019;t much care for children. Unfortunately, she had two. Their father, Eddie Maxwell, was a successful songwriter and gag man; he was a brilliant, handsome, hugely charismatic man, but he had a secret drug habit that sent him careening between warm and loving parent one day, to hair-trigger monster the next.&nbsp; If Casey got only sporadic moments of love and caring, Chris got nothing. Neither Eddie nor Eve ever had a kind thought for their youngest child. And so the sisters were forced to find their own paths through this horrific excuse of a childhood, each making choices that pulled them farther and farther apart when the one thing they needed was each other. Told without an ounce of self-pity or bitterness, this story is unique as well as universal. The scenes of pain and incredible neglect live side by side with amazing moments of humor, courage, and triumph.&nbsp;</p><p>CASEY MAXWELL CLAIR&nbsp;has worked in the entertainment industry for over twenty-five years. She began her career designing major motion picture campaigns and subsequently served as the Director of Advertising for Warner Bros. and ABC Motion Pictures, as well as Vice President of Advertising and Promotion for CBS Television Network.

The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.</p><p>Machine learning makes use of computer programs to discover meaningful patters in complex data.

The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child' scream in the fog, and most dreadfully -- and for Kipps most tragically -- <i>The Woman in Black.</i> </p><p><i>The Woman in Black</i> is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler -- proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.</p>Susan Hill is the winner of numerous literary prizes including the Somerset Maugham award. She was awarded CBE for her services to literature earlier this year. Author of the Simon Serrailler crime series and numerous other novels, her literary memoir, Howards End Is On The Landing [9781846682667] and the ghost stories The Man In The Picture [9781846681349], The Small Hand [9781846682407], Dolly and Printers Devil Court are all published by Profile.

My parents taught my brother and me to only pick the berries that slid easily from their stems <br> to collect in our little plastic containers, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure we ate all <br> of the berries that we picked, staining our fingers and faces while leaving the majority of the actual collecting to the adults. When we got home, my mom would make a simple jam in our largest pot, with just blackberries and sugar.&nbsp;<br> My parents also loved to garden, and when we moved into a house with a yard, my dad built garden beds out of old railroad ties and filled them with fruit and vegetable plants. My mom planted an entire bed full of raspberry canes that looked like dried-up sticks; when they grew up tall and strong, they produced the most gorgeous berries. We picked them by the fistful every July and we turned our harvest into preserves and pies&#x2014;and snacks, of course. I would stand in the kitchen and help my mom fill pies with mounds of fresh berries, sugar, and a bit of spice; we rarely measured, but the results were always delicious. She would bake up little scraps of pie crust sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for me to snack on while the pies took what seemed like an eternity to cool on the counter.&nbsp;<br> The kitchen in our home was always busy and warm, and my dad cooked just as often, mostly savory dishes from his homeland of Iran. He introduced me to the flavors of Middle Eastern cooking that have become so comforting to me as an adult. But maybe more importantly, his cooking taught me how important it is to balance flavors in both sweet and savory food. In Iranian cooking, rich meat stews are tempered with cool, tart yogurt mixed with cucumbers and mint, and all sorts of pickled vegetables. Bitter tea is served with sweet dates and saffron candy.&nbsp;<br> When I moved to New York from Seattle, I thought I might go to culinary school to hone my home-cooking skills into professional ones, but after graduating college with a mountain of debt, taking on more to go to culinary school seemed like the wrong choice. Instead, I decided to get a job at a restaurant and figure out a way to get myself into the kitchen. I quickly found myself a job as a reservationist for a busy chain of teahouses, where I spent most of my time consoling frustrated customers who couldn&#x2019;t get the brunch reservation they wanted. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly the professional restaurant experience I was looking for.&nbsp;<br> I still baked at home for fun and leisure, and every once in a while I&#x2019;d bring in the treats I made to share with my coworkers and boss. When a position in the bakery of the restaurant opened up, I convinced my boss that I could handle the kitchen (anything was better than answering the phone all day!) and pick up the skills I needed on the job. He gave me a&nbsp;chance.&nbsp;<br> That chance turned into many years of apron- and clog-clad early mornings making scones and icing cakes, and of coming home from work smelling sweet and floury. I had burns all over my arms from the broken oven doors that swung closed unexpectedly, but I was strong from lugging around fifty-pound bags of sugar and cases of butter. I learned how to make the best buttery pie crusts and tall, frosting-covered layer cakes. I loved the work. Sometimes I miss those early morning walks across a quiet Central Park to bake hundreds of scones before the city even woke up. There was magic in those hours, and even though I don&#x2019;t work as a baker anymore, I have returned to baking at home for fun, and I share it all on my blog, <i>Apt. 2B Baking Co.,</i> which celebrates seasonal desserts <br> and preserves.<br> Although my current life in Brooklyn involves a &#x201c;garden&#x201d; of a few potted tomato plants and herbs on my fire escape, I make sure to embrace the seasons at my local farmers&#x2019; market. I&#x2019;m always looking for new, interesting dishes to cook and bake, but what I love most is reflecting seasonality through the ingredients I use, all while keeping the idea of balanced flavors in mind. I eagerly anticipate rhubarb in the spring, berries and stone fruit in the summer, apples and squash in the fall, and glorious citrus to brighten up cold East Coast winters. Then I celebrate the seasons&#x2019; finest produce by tucking it into pies, cakes, and whatever else I can dream up and I also preserve the season with my own homemade jams. This book is filled with just those types of recipes.<br> We start in the spring, when everything is fresh and new. Fruit is slow to emerge, but there is plenty to do with strawberries and rhubarb. The bright flavors of spring&#x2019;s first green herbs are perfect for infusing into ice cream and panna cotta. In the summer, the variety and abundance of fruit can be almost overwhelming; in that section of the book, you will find pages of baked desserts, as well as cooling treats like granitas and sorbets, and jams to save the season. Fall highlights crisp apples and pears topped with oaty crumble and tucked into tarts. Musky Concord grapes will be turned into pie and roasted squash spun into ice cream or folded into nutty cake batter. In the winter, we move to warm, comforting recipes that will keep homes and bellies warm, and sunny citrus recipes that can brighten up the darkest January days.<br> This collection of recipes was written with peak-season fruit in mind, <br> but some recipes straddle the seasons as spring turns to summer, summer to fall, and so on. So while this book is organized seasonally, it&#x2019;s best to think of the year as a continuum. Some years we are lucky and there are fresh figs at the market while the berries are still flourishing and the first grapes of fall are being pulled from their vines. Raspberries hit their peak at the height of summer, but often reappear in fall for a brief moment, perfectly timed to combine with the first tart red cranberries. Apples are plucked from their branches starting in late summer, but storage apples are available year-round. While winter is prime citrus season, when we have the biggest variety of lemons, oranges, and grapefruits, you will still find citrus zest and juice in recipes throughout the book. We are lucky <br> in New York to have beautiful and bountiful farmers&#x2019; markets, and I do my best to source my produce from local farmers. I encourage you to <br> keep a close eye on what is available at the markets where you live and <br> do the same.<br> The recipes in this book range from simple, five-ingredient affairs to more complex and involved baking endeavors like laminated pastry dough and composed tarts. My hope is that you&#x2019;ll find something that&#x2019;s just your speed, and that these recipes show the wide range of desserts you can make that highlight fresh, seasonal fruit all year. At the end of the book, you&#x2019;ll find a section full of basic recipes like oaty crisp topping, buttery pie crusts made with both whole grain and all purpose flours, pastry cream, and homemade vanilla extract and cr�me fra�che, among others. These recipes serve as the basis of many recipes throughout the book, and once you get the hang of them, I hope you&#x2019;ll feel free to freestyle some fruit desserts of your own.</p><h2>City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America</h2><p>The epic of Chicago is the story of the emergence of modern America. Here, witness Chicago's growth from a desolate fur-trading post in the 1830s to one of the world's most explosively alive cities by 1900.<br><br>Donald Miller's powerful narrative embraces it all: Chicago's wild beginnings, its reckless growth, its natural calamities (especially the Great Fire of 1871), its raucous politics, its empire-building businessmen, its world-transforming architecture, its rich mix of cultures, its community of young writers and journalists, and its staggering engineering projects&#x2014;which included the reversal of the Chicago River and raising the entire city from prairie mud to save it from devastating cholera epidemics. The saga of Chicago's unresolved struggle between order and freedom, growth and control, capitalism and community, remains instructive for our time, as we seek ways to build and maintain cities that retain their humanity without losing their energy. <i>City of the Century</i> throbs with the pulse of the great city it brilliantly brings to life.</p><p>Donald L. Miller&nbsp;is the John Henry MacCracken Professor of History Emeritus at Lafayette College and author of&nbsp;ten books, including&nbsp;<i>Vicksburg</i>, and <i>Masters of the Air</i>, currently being made into a television series by Tom Hanks. He has hosted, coproduced, or served as historical consultant for more than&nbsp;thirty television documentaries and has written for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>, and other publications.A picaresque biography of a picaresque city; a thick tome that, despite its weight, one puts down with reluctance. Miller (History/Lafayette College; Lewis Mumford: A Life, 1989) begins in 1673, with Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet, the first Europeans to explore the site. But the true focus of the narrative is the 19th century, following Chicago's explosive growth from a small fort in 1803 to a sprawling city of more than a million people 90 years later. The climax of the book is Chicago's 1893 Columbia Exposition, an almost unimaginably opulent, massive display of American achievement. It was appropriate that this world's fair commemorating 400 years of American development should be hosted by Chicago, writes Miller, who embraces the common thesis that 19th-century Chicago was the most American of American cities: ``the epic of Chicago is the story of the emergence of modern America.'' But Miller takes the argument one step further, asserting that Chicago differed from the rest of the country because it took the most significant trends shaping America to their extremes, for better and for worse. Nowhere else was unbridled capitalism given such free reign. Nowhere else was there a location so ideally suited to the production of wealth and the emergence of ``the most compelling of all creations of the 19th century, the wildly expanding industrial metropolis, city of smoke and steel and sweat.'' Miller describes Chicago as a ``living drama'' peopled by colorful, complex characters: industrial and merchandising geniuses who created jobs but exploited and denigrated their workers, for example; or the corrupt politicians who nonetheless also gave much to their constituents. Miller argues that Chicago illuminates our era as well. Capitalism's pluses and minuses, the influence of the city, the responsibilities and limitations of government, the ferment that generates artistic creativity, and other very modern issues are made clearer by this epic history. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Descriptions on the beneficial effects of yoga, meditation and metaphysics are fascinating. Sri M is often termed as modern day Kabir Das.</p><p>-- The Hindu</p><p> </p><p>It is prophetic that he will use the name 'Sri M', which will remind him of his Babaji Maheshwarnath, who comes across as the "great master, wise, powerful and loving." The book is, in fact, a tribute to him. For anybody who has interest in mysticism, Sufism and Vedanta, Sri M's autobiography is, indeed, a treasure-trove.</p><p>-- The Organizer</p><p> </p><p>What stands out about this book is that its narrative exudes a sense of wonder, for the author often uses the word 'strange' to describe his experiences. Some of the instances that he recounts challenge your sense of belief and disbelief so much, that you don't quite know what to believe. But a little deeper reading, however, renders more meaning to the narrative than is apparent at first glance. He deals easily and honestly with the mistrust between religions just as he also shows how these boundaries can melt away.<br> </p><p> --'Speaking Tree', The Times of India</p></p><h2>Living in the Long Emergency: Global Crisis, the Failure of the Futurists, and the Early Adapters Who Are Showing Us the Way Forward</h2><p><p><strong>Forget the speculation of pundits and media personalities. For anyone asking &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d; the answer is out there. You just have to know where to look.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>In his 2005 book, <em>The Long Emergency</em>, James Howard Kunstler described the global predicaments that would pitch the USA into political and economic turmoil in the 21st century&#x2014;the end of affordable oil, climate irregularities, and flagging economic growth, to name a few. Now, he returns with a book that takes an up-close-and-personal approach to how real people are living <em>now</em>&#x2014;surviving The Long Emergency as it happens.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through his popular blog, Clusterf**ck Nation, Kunstler has had the opportunity to connect with people from across the country. They&#x2019;ve shared their stories with him&#x2014;sometimes over years of correspondence&#x2014;and in <em>Living in the Long Emergency: Global Crisis, the Failure of the Futurists, and the Early Adapters Who Are Showing Us the Way Forward</em>, he shares them with us, offering an eye-opening and unprecedented look at what&#x2019;s really going on &#x201c;out there&#x201d; in the US&#x2014;and beyond.</p> <p>Coming from all walks of life, the individuals you&#x2019;ll meet in these pages have one thing in common: their stories acutely illustrate the changing realities real people are facing&#x2014;and coping with&#x2014;every day. In profiles of their fascinating lives, Kunstler paints vivid, human portraits that offer a &#x201c;slice of life&#x201d; from people whose struggles and triumphs all too often go ignored.&nbsp;</p> <p>With personal accounts from a Vermont baker, homesteaders, a building contractor in the Baltimore ghetto, a white nationalist, and many more, <em>Living in the Long Emergency</em> is a unique and timely exploration of how the lives of everyday Americans are being transformed, for better and for worse, and what these stories tell us both about the future and about human perseverance.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>James Howard Kunstler</strong> is the author of more than twenty books, both nonfiction and fiction, including<em> The Geography of Nowhere</em>, <em>The Long Emergency</em>, <em>Too Much Magic</em>, and the World Made By Hand series, set in a post-economic-collapse American future.

You can almost smell the flora in the marsh, feel the planks of the rough-built structures under your bare feet. <i>The Boatman&#x2019;s Daughter</i> is a supernatural cousin to Daniel Woodrell&#x2019;s gritty Ozarks thrillers; a sensual wetlands fable rich in sensory detail and replete with Slavic folklore.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Christopher Buehlman, author of <i>The Suicide Motor Club</i></b></p><p><i>&#x201c;The Boatman&#x2019;s Daughter&#x2015;</i>a beautiful and brutal Southern Gothic that enchants and horrifies and hits like a wrecking ball from its opening pages&#x2015;is fantastic in every sense of the word.

I have to admit that I was pretty surprised! The usual format with the story remains with 2 parts separated by an interlude, part one starting not too far from the closing events of the last but with enough time for some semblance of normality to return. In this first part there is a recap of the previous installment. This is done in a really subtle way and doesn't feel pushed into the story, it's perfect for anyone who hasn't read book 4 since it was released.<br><br>But I know that what you all really want to know about is what is happening with Lily and Sebastian! Setting up your two main protagonists in a potential relationship is always going to be a difficult dynamic to traverse. I have to say, whilst it was something I had been rooting for, I was worried about how it would affect their characters. It was therefore important to get this part right and I have to admit I found Sherrer's approach to be refreshing. The potential for romance can sometimes lead to the story being overrun by it, and whilst Lily and Sebastian are often frustrating in their courtship, they are also really endearing. Not all relationships start as epic love stories and the opening lines about opposites attract, does set the tone perfectly for them.<br><br>The second part truly shows off Sherrer's writing skill, as a utterly breathtaking action packed set piece takes up much of the final quarter of the book. That this level of action continues without let up or feeling repetitive is really something special, I defy anyone to put it down in these final stages. From Agent Grant to the Fae, everyone plays a part in this show down which takes more than one or two unexpected twists.<br><br>What I really liked about the book as a whole was the full introduction of a new big bad, for those who have also read the novella Cat Magic there will be a familiarity already. I didn't feel that the story needed a break from John Faust, until one was there and it actually gave a refreshing change of pace and given the fragility of Lily and Sebastian's situation I think adding John Faust to the mix may have left the book feeling angsty. Sir Kipling remains the real star of the piece and of the series as a whole, he brings things together so perfectly often voicing/meowing the opinions that needed to be said. The ending is unexpected, whilst the epilogues traditionally wrap things up, this one ends on a real cliff hanger which isn't usual for the series, but honestly, It couldn't have ended any other way.<br><br>I loved this book just as I have loved every one before it, 5 stars!<br><br><i>-Gaynor of Post Apocalyptic Playground Book Ramblings and Reviews</i></p><h2>Thinking Inside the Box: Adventures with Crosswords and the Puzzling People Who Can&#39;t Live Without Them</h2><p><b><b>A delightful, erudite, and immersive exploration of the crossword puzzle and its fascinating history from a brilliant young writer</b></b><br><br>The crossword is a feature of the modern world, inspiring daily devotion and obsession from not just everyday citizens looking to pass the time but icons of American life, such as Bill Clinton, Yo-Yo Ma, and Martha Stewart.

Indeed, paradoxically, its popularity has never been greater, even as the world of media and newspapers, its natural habitat, has undergone a perilous digital transformation. But why, exactly, are its satisfactions so sweet that over the decades has it become a fixture of breakfast tables, nightstands, and commutes, and even given rise to competitive crossword tournaments? <br><br>Blending first-person reporting from the world of crosswords with a delightful telling of its rich literary history, Adrienne Raphel dives into the secrets of this classic pastime. At the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, she rubs shoulders with elite solvers of the world, doing her level best to hold her own; aboard a crossword themed cruise, she picks the brains of the enthusiasts whose idea of a good time is a week on the high seas with nothing but crosswords to do; and, visiting the home and office of Will Shortz, <i>New York Times</i> crossword puzzle editor and NPR's official "Puzzlemaster," she goes behind the scenes to see for herself how the world's gold standard of puzzles is made. <br><br>Equal parts ingenious and fun, <i>Thinking Inside the Box</i> is a love letter to the infinite joys and playful possibilities of language, and will be a treat for die-hard cruciverbalists and first-time solvers alike.</p><p>Adrienne Raphel has written for <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New Republic, Slate, </i>and <i>Poetry,</i> among other publications.

These breakthrough discoveries show that the vagina, clitoris, and labia&#x2014;the female sexual centers&#x2014;are not "merely flesh," but directly affect the female brain, and that the female brain directly affects, in newly documented ways, the vagina and female sexual centers. The vagina thus has a fundamental relationship to female consciousness itself. Utterly enthralling and totally fascinating, <em>Vagina</em> draws on this set of insights about "the mind-vagina connection" to reveal new information about what women really need, on many different levels, and considers what sexual relationships&#x2014;and a woman's relationship to her self, as well as to her own desire and pleasure&#x2014;transformed by these insights, may look like.</p><p>A brilliant and nuanced synthesis of physiology, history, and cultural criticism, <em>Vagina</em> explores the physical, political, and spiritual implications for women&#x2014;and for society as a whole&#x2014;in this startling series of new scientific breakthroughs from a writer whose conviction and keen intelligence have propelled her works to the tops of bestseller lists, and firmly into the realm of modern classics.</p><p>Naomi Wolf is the author of seven books, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Beauty Myth</em>, <em>Promiscuities</em>, <em>Misconceptions</em>, <em>The End of America</em>, and <em>Give Me Liberty</em>.

As we walk with Jesus, hopefully we, too, will come to see Jesus as his disciples did: as a living, breathing, ever-present friend, mentor, and teacher.</p><p><b>Greg Laurie</b> is senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California, which he started as a Bible study of 30 people.

He doesn't solve problems, enforce rules or arrest criminals. He knows that nobody in tiny Potts County actually wants to follow the law and he is perfectly content lazing about, eating five meals a day, and sleeping with all the eligible women.<br><br>Still, Nick has some very complex problems to deal with. Two local pimps have been sassing him, ruining his already tattered reputation. His girlfriend Rose is being terrorized by her husband. And then, there's his wife and her brother Lenny who won't stop troubling Nick's already stressed mind. Are they a little too close for a brother and a sister? <br><br>With an election coming up, Nick needs to fix his problems and fast. Because the one thing Nick does know is that he will do anything to stay sheriff. Because, as it turns out, Sheriff Nick Corey is not nearly as dumb as he seems.<br><br>In <i>Pop. 1280</i>, widely regarded as a classic of mid-20th century crime, Thompson offers up one of his best, in a tale of lust, murder, and betrayal in the Deep South that was the basis for the critically acclaimed French film <i>Coup de Torchon</i>.</p><p>As high sheriff of Potts County, Nick Corey spends most of his time eating, sleeping and avoiding trouble. If only people--especially some troublesome pimps, his foul-tempered wife, and his half-witted brother-in-law--would stop pushing him around. Because when Nick is pushed, he begins to kill . . . or to make others do his killing for him!Jim Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i>when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals.

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p>"A masterful picture of Wales in the 13th century...vivdly pictured as grandly beautiful, its people volatile, stubborn and mystic."<br>THE SAN DIEGO UNION<br>Thirteenth-century Wales is a divided country, ever at the mercy of England's ruthless, power-hungry King John.

Walking into a room and seeing your girlfriend reading a baby-name book can kind of make your heart stop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no expert,&#x201d; I began, choosing my words carefully. &#x201c;Well&#x2014;actually, I am. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure there are certain things we have to do before you need to be reading that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney Sage, the aforementioned girlfriend and light of my life, didn&#x2019;t even look up, though a hint of a smile played at her lips. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for the initiation,&#x201d; she said matter-of-factly, as though she were talking about getting her nails done or picking up groceries instead of joining a coven of witches. &#x201c;I have to have a &#x2018;magical&#x2019; name they use during their gatherings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Magical name, initiation. Just another day in the life, huh?&#x201d; Not that I was one to talk, seeing as I was a vampire with the fantastic yet complicated abilities to heal and compel people.</p><p>This time, I got a full smile, and she lifted her gaze. Afternoon sunlight filtering through my bedroom window caught her eyes and brought out the amber glints within them. They widened in surprise when she noticed the three stacked boxes I was carrying. &#x201c;What are those?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A revolution in music,&#x201d; I declared, reverently setting them on the floor. I opened the top one and unveiled a record player. &#x201c;I saw a sign that some guy was selling them on campus.&#x201d; I opened a box full of records and lifted out <i>Rumours</i> by Fleetwood Mac. &#x201c;Now I can listen to music in its purest form.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t look impressed; surprising for someone who thought my 1967 Mustang&#x2014;which she&#x2019;d named the Ivashkinator&#x2014;was some sort of holy shrine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure digital music is as pure as it gets. That was a waste of money, Adrian. I can fit all the songs in those boxes on my phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you fit the other six boxes that are in my car on your phone?&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked in astonishment and then turned wary. &#x201c;Adrian, how much did you pay for all that?&#x201d;</p><p>I waved off the question. &#x201c;Hey, I can still make the car payment. Barely.&#x201d; I at least didn&#x2019;t have to pay rent, since the place was prepaid, but I had plenty of other bills. &#x201c;Besides, I&#x2019;ve got a bigger budget for this kind of stuff now that <i>someone</i> made me quit smoking and cut back on happy hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More like happy day,&#x201d; she said archly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking out for your health.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat down beside her on the bed. &#x201c;Just like I&#x2019;m looking out for you and your caffeine addiction.&#x201d; It was a deal we&#x2019;d made, forming our own sort of support group. I&#x2019;d quit smoking and cut back to one drink a day. She&#x2019;d ousted her obsessive dieting for a healthy number of calories and was down to only one cup of coffee a day. Surprisingly, she&#x2019;d had a harder time with that than I&#x2019;d had with alcohol. In those first few days, I thought I&#x2019;d have to check her into caffeine rehab.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t an addiction,&#x201d; she grumbled, still bitter. &#x201c;More of a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lifestyle choice.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed and drew her face to mine in a kiss, and just like that, the rest of the world vanished. There were no name books, no records, no habits. There was just her and the feel of her lips, the exquisite way they managed to be soft and fierce at the same time. The rest of the world thought she was stiff and cold. Only I knew the truth about the passion and hunger that was locked up within her&#x2014;well, me and Jill, the girl who could see inside my mind because of a psychic bond we shared.</p><p>As I laid Sydney back on the bed, I had that faint, fleeting thought I always had, of how taboo what we were doing was. Humans and Moroi vampires had stopped intermingling when my race hid from the world in the Dark Ages. We&#x2019;d done it for safety, deciding it was best if humans didn&#x2019;t know of our existence. Now, my people and hers (the ones who knew about Moroi) considered relationships like this wrong and, among some circles, dark and twisted. But I didn&#x2019;t care. I didn&#x2019;t care about anything except her and the way touching her drove me wild, even as her calm and steady presence soothed the storms that raged within me.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t mean we flaunted this, though. In fact, our romance was a tightly guarded secret, one that required a lot of sneaking around and carefully calculated planning. Even now, the clock was ticking. This was our weekday pattern. She had an independent study for her last period of the day at school, one managed by a lenient teacher who let her take off early and race over here. We&#x2019;d get one precious hour of making out or talking&#x2014;usually making out, made more frantic by the pressure bearing down on us&#x2014;and then she was back to her private school, just as her clingy and vampire-hating sister Zoe got out of class.</p><p>Somehow, Sydney had an internal clock that told her when time was up. I think it was part of her inherent ability to keep track of a hundred things at once. Not me. In these moments, my thoughts were usually focused on getting her shirt off and whether I&#x2019;d get past the bra this time. So far, I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>She sat up, cheeks flushed and golden hair tousled. She was so beautiful that it made my soul ache. I always wished desperately that I could paint her in these moments and immortalize that look in her eyes. There was a softness in them that I rarely saw at other times, a total and complete vulnerability in someone who was normally so guarded and analytical in the rest of her life. But although I was a decent painter, capturing her on canvas was beyond my skill.</p><p>She collected her brown blouse and buttoned it up, hiding the brightness of turquoise lace with the conservative attire she liked to armor herself in. She&#x2019;d done an overhaul of her bras in the last month, and though I was always sad to see them disappear, it made me happy to know they were there, those secret spots of color in her life.</p><p>As she walked over to the mirror at my dresser, I summoned some of the spirit magic within me to get a glimpse of her aura, the energy that surrounded all living things. The magic brought a brief surge of pleasure inside me, and then I saw it, that shining light around her. It was its typical self, a scholar&#x2019;s yellow balanced with the richer purple of passion and spirituality. A blink of the eye, and her aura faded away, as did the deadly exhilaration of spirit.</p><p>She finished smoothing her hair and looked down. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; I came to stand behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist. Then, I saw what she&#x2019;d picked up and stiffened: sparkling cuff links set with rubies and diamonds. And just like that, the warmth and joy I&#x2019;d just felt were replaced by a cold but familiar darkness. &#x201c;They were a birthday present from Aunt Tatiana a few years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney held one up and studied it with an expert eye. She grinned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a fortune here. This is platinum. Sell these and you&#x2019;d have allowance for life. And all the records you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d sleep in a cardboard box before I sold those.&#x201d;</p><p>She noticed the change in me and turned around, her expression filled with concern. &#x201c;Hey, I was just joking.&#x201d; Her hand gently touched my face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t okay. The world was suddenly a cruel, hopeless place, empty with the loss of my aunt, queen of the Moroi and the only relative who hadn&#x2019;t judged me. I felt a lump in my throat, and the walls seemed to close in on me as I remembered the way she&#x2019;d been stabbed to death and how they&#x2019;d paraded those bloody pictures around when trying to find her killer. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the killer was locked away and slated for execution. It wouldn&#x2019;t bring Aunt Tatiana back. She was gone, off to places I couldn&#x2019;t follow&#x2014;at least not yet&#x2014;and I was here, alone and insignificant and floundering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Adrian.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney&#x2019;s voice was calm but firm, and slowly, I dredged myself out of the despair that could come on so quickly and heavily, a darkness that had increased over the years the more I used spirit. It was the price for that kind of power, and these sudden shifts had become more and more frequent recently. I focused on her eyes, and the light returned to the world. I still ached for my aunt, but Sydney was here, my hope and my anchor. I wasn&#x2019;t alone. I wasn&#x2019;t misunderstood. Swallowing, I nodded and gave her a weak smile as spirit&#x2019;s dark hand released its hold on me. For now.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; Seeing the doubt in her face, I pressed a kiss to her forehead. &#x201c;Really. You need to go, Sage. You&#x2019;ll make Zoe wonder, and you&#x2019;ll be late for your witch meeting.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at me with concern a few moments longer and then relaxed a little. &#x201c;Okay. But if you need anything&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know. Call on the Love Phone.&#x201d;</p><p>That brought her smile back. We&#x2019;d recently acquired secret prepaid cell phones that the Alchemists, the organization she worked for, wouldn&#x2019;t be able to track. Not that they regularly tracked her main phone&#x2014;but they certainly could if they thought something suspicious was happening, and we didn&#x2019;t want a trail of texts and calls.</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll come by tonight,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>At that, her features hardened again. &#x201c;Adrian, no. It&#x2019;s too risky.&#x201d;</p><p>Another of spirit&#x2019;s benefits was the ability to visit people in their dreams. It was a handy way to talk since we didn&#x2019;t have a lot of time together in the waking world&#x2014;and because we didn&#x2019;t spend much time talking in the waking world these days&#x2014;but like any use of spirit, it was a continual risk to my sanity. It worried her a lot, but I considered it a small thing in order to be with her.</p><p>&#x201c;No arguments,&#x201d; I warned. &#x201c;I want to know how things go. And I know you&#x2019;ll want to know how things go for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Adrian&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it short,&#x201d; I promised.</p><p>She reluctantly agreed&#x2014;not looking happy at all&#x2014;and I walked her out to the door. As we cut through the living room, she paused at a small terrarium sitting near the window. Smiling, she knelt down and tapped the glass. Inside was a dragon.</p><p>No, really. Technically, it was called a callistana, but we rarely used that term. We usually called him Hopper. Sydney had summoned him from some demonic realm as a sort of helper. Mostly he seemed to want to help us out by eating all the junk food in my apartment. She and I were tied to him, and to maintain his health, we had to take turns hanging out with him. Since Zoe had moved in, however, my place had become his primary residence. Sydney lifted the lid of the tank and let the small golden-scaled creature scurry into her hand. He gazed up at her adoringly, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him for that.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been out for a while,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You ready to take a break?&#x201d; Hopper could exist in this living form or be transformed into a small statue, which helped avoid uncomfortable questions when people came by. Only she could transform him, though.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. He keeps trying to eat my paints. And I don&#x2019;t want him to watch me kiss you goodbye.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave him a light tickle on the chin and spoke the words that turned him into a statue. Life was certainly easier that way, but again, his health required he come out now and then. That, and the little guy <i>had</i> grown on me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him for a while,&#x201d; she said, slipping him into her purse. Even if he was inert, he still benefited from being near her.</p><p>Free of his beady little gaze, I gave her a long kiss goodbye, one I was reluctant to let end. I cupped her face in my hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Escape plan number seventeen,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Run away and open a juice stand in Fresno.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why Fresno?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like the kind of place people drink a lot of juice.&#x201d;</p><p>She grinned and kissed me again. The &#x201c;escape plans&#x201d; were a running joke with us, always far-fetched and numbered in no particular order. I usually made them up on the spot. What was sad, though, was that they were actually more thought out than any real plans we had. Both of us were painfully aware that we were very much living in the now, with a future that was anything but clear.</p><p>Breaking that second kiss was difficult too, but she finally managed it, and I watched her walk away. My apartment seemed dimmer in her absence.</p><p>I brought in the rest of the boxes from my car and sifted through the treasures within. Most of the albums were from the sixties and seventies, with a little eighties here and there. They weren&#x2019;t organized, but I didn&#x2019;t make any attempts at that. Once Sydney got over her stance that they were a wasteful splurge, she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to help herself and would end up sorting them all by artist or genre or color. For now, I set up the record player in my living room and pulled out an album at random: <i>Machine Head</i> by Deep Purple.</p><p>I had a few more hours until dinner, so I crouched down in front of an easel, staring up at the blank canvas as I tried to decide how to deal with my current assignment in advanced oil painting: a self-portrait. It didn&#x2019;t have to be an exact likeness. It could be abstract. It could be anything, so long as it was representative of me. And I was stumped. I could&#x2019;ve painted anyone else I knew. Maybe I couldn&#x2019;t capture that exact look of rapture Sydney had in my arms, but I could paint her aura or the color of her eyes. I could have painted the wistful, fragile face of my friend Jill Mastrano Dragomir, a young princess of the Moroi. I could have painted flaming roses in tribute to my ex-girlfriend, who&#x2019;d torn my heart apart yet still managed to make me admire her.</p><p>But myself? I didn&#x2019;t know what to do for me. Maybe it was just an artistic block. Maybe I didn&#x2019;t know myself. As I stared at the canvas, my frustration growing, I had to fight off the need to go to my neglected liquor cupboard and pour a drink. Alcohol didn&#x2019;t necessarily make for the best art, but it usually inspired something. I could practically taste the vodka already. I could mix it with orange juice and pretend I was being healthy. My fingers twitched, and my feet nearly carried me to the kitchen&#x2014;but I resisted. The earnestness in Sydney&#x2019;s eyes burned through my mind, and I focused back on the canvas. I could do this&#x2014;sober. I&#x2019;d promised her I&#x2019;d have only one drink a day, and I&#x2019;d hold true to that. And for the time being, that one drink was needed for the end of the day, when I was ready for bed. I didn&#x2019;t sleep well. I never had in my entire life, so I had to use whatever help I could get.</p><p>My sober resolve didn&#x2019;t result in inspiration, though, and when five o&#x2019;clock came around, the canvas remained bare. I stood up and stretched out the kinks in my body, feeling a return of that earlier darkness. It was more angry than sad, laced with the frustration of not being able to do this. My art teachers claimed I had talent, but in moments like this, I felt like the slacker most people had always said I was, destined for a lifetime of failure. It was especially depressing when I thought about Sydney, who knew everything about everything and could excel at any career she wanted. Putting aside the vampire-human problem, I had to wonder what I could possibly offer her. I couldn&#x2019;t even pronounce half the things that interested her, let alone discuss them. If we ever managed some normal life together, she&#x2019;d be out paying the bills while I stayed home and cleaned. And I really wasn&#x2019;t good at that either. If she just wanted to come home at night to eye candy with good hair, I could probably be that reasonably well.</p><p>I knew these fears eating at me were...</p></p><h2>Night Moves (A Doc Ford Novel)</h2><p><b>Doc Ford has his share of secrets. One of them has returned with a vengeance in this deadly&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller from Randy Wayne White.</b><br><br>While trying to solve one of Florida&#x2019;s most profound mysteries, Doc Ford is the target of a murder attempt by someone who wants to make it look like an accident. Or is the target actually his friend Tomlinson? Whatever the answer, the liveaboards and fishing guides at Dinkin&#x2019;s Bay on Sanibel Island are becoming increasingly nervous&#x2014;and wary&#x2014;after a plane crash and other near-death incidents make it apparent that Ford and Tomlinson are dangerous companions.<br><br>What their small family of friends doesn&#x2019;t know is that their secret pasts make it impossible for them to seek help from the law. There is an assassin on the loose, and it is up to Doc and Tomlinson to find a killer before the grisly job is done.</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b>&nbsp;is the author of the Doc Ford novels, the Hannah Smith novels, and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years, and spends much of his free time windsurfing, playing baseball, and hanging out at Doc Ford's Rum Bar &amp; Grille.In Gone (2012), White introduced fishing guide Hannah Smith, hinting that she was interested in a relationship with marine biologist Doc Ford, the hero of White&#x2019;s acclaimed main series. Those hints almost come to fruition in the twentieth Ford novel, despite Ford&#x2019;s conviction that his other &#x201c;job,&#x201d; covert ops, won&#x2019;t mix with relationships. There are other roadblocks to romance, starting with a psycho convinced that Ford&#x2019;s opposition to &#x201c;jig-fishing&#x201d; for tarpon has cost him his shot at becoming a big-time documentarian. Then there&#x2019;s Ford&#x2019;s obsession with the disappearance of five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers in 1945, and finally, the presence on Ford&#x2019;s Sanibel Island home turf of a mysterious Brazilian who may also dabble in covert ops. Any of these plot strands might have made a novel in itself, and White has some trouble balancing them all. Still, for series fans, the overabundance of plot won&#x2019;t matter a whit. Call it a transitional episode with lots of distractions, if you must, but fans will still be riveted by Ford and Hannah&#x2019;s tango-like mating dance. And the climax is a corker, too. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Over his last several Doc Ford novels, White has vaulted to mainstream bestseller stauts. This one is likely to maintain the pattern. --Bill Ott</p><h2>One Thousand White Women (20th Anniversary Edition): The Journals of May Dodd: A Novel (One Thousand White Women Series, 1)</h2><p><p><i>One Thousand White Women</i> is the story of May Dodd and a colorful assembly of pioneer women who, under the auspices of the U.S. government, travel to the western prairies in 1875 to intermarry among the Cheyenne Indians. The covert and controversial "Brides for Indians" program, launched by the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, is intended to help assimilate the Indians into the white man's world. Toward that end May and her friends embark upon the adventure of their lifetime.

Yet the unknown is a far better fate than the life she left behind: committed to an insane asylum by her blueblood family for the crime of loving a man beneath her station, May finds that her only hope of freedom is to participate in a secret government program whereby women from the "civilized" world become the brides of Cheyenne warriors. What follows is the story of May's breathtaking adventures: her brief, passionate romance with the gallant young army captain John Bourke; her marriage to the great chief Little Wolf; and her conflict of being caught between two worlds, loving two men, living two lives. </p><p>So vividly has Jim Fergus depicted the American West that May Dodd's journals are like a capsule in time.</p></p><h2>The Berenstain Bears: Thanksgiving All Around</h2><p><p>Young readers will experience the joys of fall in Bear Country with this brand-new Berenstain Bears storybook.

Native Americans depended on birds, mammals, and fish for sustenance and the state&#x2019;s first Europeans came in search of Beaver and buckskins. Although the state&#x2019;s wildlife is still an important resource for human consumption, wildlife is also increasingly important in today&#x2019;s culture for its intrinsic, aesthetic value. For many Ohioans, the age-old traditions of hunting and fishing have been replaced by a desire to simply observe wildlife and experience nature. But most Ohioans are largely unaware of the diversity of species inhabiting their state. This volume is intended to provide an introduction to the state&#x2019;s fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.<br><br>In <i>The Ohio Wildlife Encyclopedia</i>, nationally known naturalist Scott Shupe has collected information on all the wildlife that reside in the Buckeye State. The first in a series of state wildlife encyclopedias, this book will be a handy, usable, layman&#x2019;s guide to Ohio&#x2019;s wildlife.<br><br>Included are over 800 color photographs, depicting the different species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and fish, while also offering over 600 range maps to show their territory. Along with basic information for the biology of each animal, Shupe includes the size, habitat, and abundance of each species located in the state.<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re a lover of the outdoors, photography, or are looking to learn more about your state, this comprehensive guide will teach you about the wonderful wildlife that covers the water, earth, and skies of Ohio.</p><p><b>Scott Shupe</b> began his naturalist career in 1971 at the famed Ross Allen Reptile Institute in Silver Springs, Florida.

Yet in King William&#x2019;s War, the first clash between England and France for control of North America, the patterns of conflict for the next seventy years were laid, as were the goals and objectives of both sides, as well as the realization that the colonies of the two nations could not coexist.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; King William&#x2019;s War actually encompassed several proxy wars being fought by the English and the French through their native allies. The Beaver Wars was a long running feud between the Iroquois Confederacy, New France, and New France&#x2019;s native allies over control of the lucrative fur trade. Fueled by English guns and money, the Iroquois attempted to divert the French fur trade towards their English trading partners in Albany, and in the process gain control over other Indian tribes. To the east the pro-French Wabanaki of Maine, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick had earlier fought a war with New England, but English expansion and French urgings, aided by foolish moves and political blunders on the part of New England, erupted into a second Wabanaki War on the eve of King William&#x2019;s War. Thus, these two conflicts officially became one with the arrival of news of a declaration of war between France and England in 1689. The next nine years saw coordinated attacks, including French assaults on Schenectady, New York, and Massachusetts, and English attacks around Montreal and on Nova Scotia. The war ended diplomatically, but started again five years later in Queen Anne&#x2019;s War.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; A riveting history full of memorable characters and events, and supported by extensive primary source material, <i>King William&#x2019;s War: The First Contest for North America, 1689&#x2013;1697 </i>by Michael G.

They make the book an easily absorbed read and provide a welcome break from Schlessinger's angry tirades on premarital sex, addiction, and the general "stupidity" of the human race. Behind her anger, you'll find suggestions on taking time to really listen to each other, ways to respect each other's needs without catering to selfishness, and a firm belief that relationships are nearly always worth saving. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist, is one of the most popular talk-show hosts in radio history and the only woman to win the prestigious Marconi Award for syndicated radio.

As the survivors flee Jacinto, they must contend with the last of the Locust, bent on vengeance, as they struggle to stay alive in an icy wilderness. Marcus Fenix, Dom Santiago, and their fellow Gears fight to get Jacinto&#x2019;s refugees to a safe haven, but find themselves in a lawless new world where the enemy is human&#x2014;and as desperate and dangerous as any grub.</p><p>Karen Traviss is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of three previous Star Wars: Republic Commando novels: <b>Hard Contact, Triple Zero,</b> and <b>True Colors</b>; three Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novels: <b>Bloodlines, Revelation</b>, and <b>Sacrifice</b>; as well as <b>City of Pearl, Crossing the Line, The World Before, Matriarch, Ally,</b> and <b>Judge</b>.

The evacuation's already under way by road, we've got ships on standby, and this is a population that's used to emergency drills. They move when we say move. But that's the easy part. It's winter, and somehow we've got to carry enough equipment and supplies to create a giant refugee camp from scratch in the middle of nowhere, then sustain it for maybe a year. We're going to lose a lot of people, whatever happens. So let's start by accepting that.<br><br>(royston sharle, head of emergency management, jacinto.)<br><br>jacinto, one hour into the flood.<br><br>Dying really did bring its own moments of clarity, just like they said.<br><br>Bernie Mataki didn't see her life flash before her. Instead, she found herself weirdly detached, reflecting on the shitty irony of sailing halfway around the world only to drown in Jacinto.<br><br>Water. I bloody hate it. No bastard should have to drown in the middle of a city.<br><br>She could see a patch of whirling sea ten meters away, like a sink emptying down a plughole. Debris rushed toward it. Chunks of wood, vegetation, plastic, and even a dead dog-a little brown terrier thing with a red collar-raced past her on the surface to vanish into the maelstrom. A chunk of metal pipe bobbed along in its wake, clanging against her shoulder-plate and nearly taking her eye out before it spun away with the rest of the flotsam.<br><br>I'm next. Sink. Get it over with. Nowhere to swim to. Drown here now or there later . . . no, screw that, I'm a survival specialist, aren't I? Get a grip. Do something. I'm not dead yet.<br><br>"Sorrens? Sorrens?" All she could see was columns of black smoke and the occasional flash of sunlight on a distant rotor blade. The last Ravens were heading away from the stricken city. Saltwater slopped into her mouth. "Sorrens, you still there?"<br><br>There was no answer. He was the last man left of her squad; they'd fought their way to the surface, radios dead, staying a few desperate meters ahead of the flood. But the Ravens had already gone, and the sea engulfed the city. It pissed her off that Sorrens had survived the battle but that she'd lost him because the frigging COG itself pulled the plug. That felt worse than losing him to the grubs somehow.<br><br>But they thought we were dead. We can't have been the only ones who missed the RV point. How many got out alive?<br><br>Jacinto, which had always seemed so ancient and eternal, was vanishing a landmark at a time. The sea didn't give a shit about humanity's little nest-building efforts. Buildings were subsiding into the caverns beneath the city, creating whirlpools that dragged in everything on the surface. She'd be next. Her hands were aching with cold as she struggled to hang on to a roof gutter that was now at sea level. The roof itself was gone, and only the end gable jutted at a sharp angle above the water. She looked for some refuge, but there were no surfaces she could balance on, just a finial, a twin- headed heraldic eagle that loomed over her and offered nothing to settle on.<br><br>Two minutes, they said. Two minutes in icy water before hypothermia killed you. She'd been here longer than that, she was sure. And then there was the fuel floating everywhere. That wasn't going to do her a lot of good, either.<br><br>Can't let go. Bloody radio . . .<br><br>Bernie steadied herself, timing the moment to take one hand off the gutter and try her radio again. The current tugged impatiently. Once she lost her grip on her last fragile link to solid ground, the weight of her armor would drag her under. It was the modern stuff, heavier, a two-handed job to remove, not designed for long immersion. She needed both hands free to jettison any plates, and once she let go she was dead. She couldn't tread water: too exhausted, too heavy, too far from dry land.<br><br>All she could hear was the roar and crash of the sea filling the sunken city, creaks of buckling metal that sounded like screams, and a fading chakka-chakka-chakka as the last Ravens shrank to dots on the amber horizon. There was a stench of unidentifiable chemicals and sulfur, as if some kind of gas was pooling on the surface.<br><br>Shit, don't let that catch fire. I can't handle burning to death in water as well. That's one fucking irony too many.<br><br>She had to get on with it.<br><br>One . . . two . . . three.<br><br>Bernie took one hand off the gutter and waved her arm. But it was a waste of time, and she knew it; the choppers were too far away. Even the ships and small vessels were out of range. She was just one more tiny speck in a chaotic soup of debris. But now that her hand was free and she hadn't been snatched from her refuge by the force of the water, she risked turning around, trying to scan the choppy surface for signs of other survivors.<br><br>There were bodies. She could see how fast the current was running by the speed at which they shot past her.<br><br>Did they get left behind? Or did they decide to die here rather than keep running?<br><br>People did the damnedest things in disasters. Wanting to stay put was common. Bernie always prided herself on getting the hell out.<br><br>She pressed her finger hard against her earpiece, rocking it slightly to make sure the switch made contact. There was an encouraging hiss of static. It was still working despite being soaked.<br><br>"Sierra One to Control, this is Mataki . . ." Time. She just didn't have time. Even if anyone heard her, could they loop back and find her before she went under? There were no bloody miracles on the way, that she knew. If she was going to survive, she'd have to perform her own. "Sierra One to Control, this is Mataki, are you receiving?"<br><br>There was just the empty random hiss of background interference. Maybe they could hear her, though. Maybe they couldn't respond. She needed to give them a location, just in case, and tried to work out where she was in this suddenly unfamiliar landscape, but it was hard to orient herself when only her head was above water. She racked her brain for where she'd seen the eagle finial before, trying to visualize Jacinto as it had been only hours before.<br><br>"Sierra One, this is Sergeant Bernadette Mataki . . . I need extraction urgently, repeat, urgent extraction . . . my position is . . .<br><br>wait one . . ." Shit. Where the hell am I? What's that dome over there? Suddenly it came to her. "Allfathers Library, south side of the roof. I'm facing the Ginnet Mausoleum. Request immediate extraction, over."<br><br>This was the point where it suddenly got harder and demanded decisions. How long did she wait before she decided they were never coming?<br><br>Bernie found herself scanning the horizon to the east, looking to see if any of the small islands around the harbor had survived the seismic activity. If she could shed at least some of her plates-maybe grab the next chunk of debris that passed as a flotation device-then she might make it to dry ground. She could see only the outer harbor wall now, a stump of granite that had once held a lighthouse. It was a very long swim, even under the best circumstances.<br><br>"Control, I'll hang on as long as I can," she said at last. "Request immediate extraction, repeat, immediate extraction."<br><br>Bernie decided that if anyone had heard, then she'd given them long enough to triangulate on her signal. She shut down the radio to conserve power. All she could do now was stay put and try to avoid being hit by the flood of rushing debris.<br><br>How long before it gets dark?<br><br>She had two or three hours' light left. Maybe getting up on that gable end was feasible after all-if it didn't crash down on her or sink with everything else. If she moved around to the other side, a little farther along the gutter, the sloping gable would be facing away from her. She could edge her way up it.<br><br>For a moment, she felt inexplicably pleased with herself, and realized that it was because of the water-her worst nightmare, the thing she dreaded, and yet she was in control. It hadn't beaten her. If she could deal with this, anything was possible.<br><br>"Screw you," she said aloud to nobody in particular, and felt carefully beneath the water for her belt. If she took it slowly, she could find a length of line even with fingers so cold they felt like they were being crushed between rollers.<br><br>Don't drop it. No, don't open the pouch, lift it so the stuff doesn't float out.<br><br>Bernie shook out the line and almost lost it. Now the challenge was to form a loop to anchor it to something solid. Tying a bowline one- handed when someone threw you a line was a basic survival skill, but with nothing to secure it to, she had to slide the line under her other hand, the one gripping the gutter. It seemed to take ages. Eventually, gathering the line with slow care, she managed to form a noose, and clamped the end between her teeth to avoid losing the thing if she dropped it.<br><br>Pirate time. Shit, I must look like a complete dickhead.<br><br>Then she made her way hand over hand along the gutter until she was looking at the inside of the gable end. It took every scrap of strength she had left, but she dragged herself over the gutter, taking her weight on her chest, then swung one leg as if mounting a horse. The sea had now overtopped the wall. She straddled the brickwork for a moment, struggling to balance properly because her thigh plate had caught on something she couldn't see, and slowly lifted the line in both hands to try to lasso the finial.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>She missed twice. She missed a third time. Either the polymer rope was too light or she didn't have the strength now to heave it.<br><br>Again . . .<br><br>As long as she was trying, she was alive. And the effort was warming her up.<br><br>And again . . .<br><br>The loop of rope caught around the neck of the eagle with a wet slap, and she pulled the line tight. It held. The gable leaned at around fifty degrees; all she had to do was walk up that slope, even crawl, and the rope wouldn't have to take her whole weight.<br><br>It was weird how the brain compensated, she thought. Something that was plainly as dangerous as staying put had now become a sensible option. She found out just how dangerous when she tried to work out how to stand up.<br><br>The wall, of course, wasn't level. It was at the same canted angle as the gable, because the whole building had tilted. It was just the fact that it was broken-split vertically-that gave her hands and backside the illusion of its being level. When she pulled one leg out of the water and jammed the heel of her boot into a gap in the brickwork, she found herself slipping toward the gable. Standing up took a massive effort that was more like an explosive squat. Her face smacked into the bricks, and she found herself spread-eagled on the inner surface of the gable, one boot on the wall and the other dangling in the sea that had filled the building.<br><br>But she had the rope in one fist, and she was mostly out of the water. It left her feeling heavy and oddly warm. Now all she had to do was climb.<br><br>Easy. Really, it is.<br><br>Bernie had to believe that. And she had to think no further than the next step. That was how you kept going, one hurdle at a time, then the next, and the next, until the huge task had been chipped away.<br><br>Now she was halfway up the slope. When she got close to the top, she'd work out how to secure herself with the rope, free both hands so she could assess any injuries, check that her Lancer still worked, and see what kit she still had in her belt pouches.<br><br>And time to call in again. Shit, they can't have lost all comms, can they?<br><br>She lay flat and listened for a moment. The city still groaned and screamed as the weight of water crushed it. But that was a little further away; closer to her, she could hear rhythmic slaps on the water, as if someone was swimming.<br><br>I'm not alone. God, I'm not alone. It's Sorrens. He made it.<br><br>Bernie took a few breaths and gathered her strength to sit up as best she could and take a look. Before she did, she tried calling Control again.<br><br>"Control, this is Mataki, requesting immediate extraction. My position is the Allfathers Library roof." She could still hear the splashing. It was getting closer. "Control, come in . . ."<br><br>The splashing stopped.<br><br>Bernie raised her head and looked down at the sea. Now that she was facing away from Jacinto's death throes, the seascape simply looked stormy, the drifting smoke more like dark clouds than the end of urban society. She couldn't see anyone in the water-nobody alive, anyway.<br><br>"Sorrens?"<br><br>She couldn't ignore what she'd heard. She tugged on the line to make sure it was secure, then tied the other end around her waist like a safety line. She was losing body heat, she reminded herself, and there was a cold night ahead, so any survivors would stand a better chance if they huddled together.<br><br>Braking her slide with her heels, she edged down to the top of the wall again, wondering how she'd haul him inboard. The sea looked almost solid, like churning, oily lumps rather than water. She strained to see a head bobbing between waves. Nothing.<br><br>Then the water erupted.<br><br>A body burst through the surface like a porpoise breaching. She sucked in a breath, jerking back, because it wasn't Sorrens, and it took her a second in her exhausted state to register that fact.<br><br>She was face-to-face with a Locust drone, a big gray bastard of a grub. It could swim. It should have been dead. It wasn't. It scrambled for the wall, her wall, her safe haven.<br><br>"Shit," she said, and reached for the knife in her boot.<br><br>king raven kr-239,<br><br>en route to port farrall.<br><br>The comms link crackled in Dominic Santiago's earpiece. "KR-Two-Three- Nine to Control. Are you receiving that signal?"<br><br>Oh shit oh shit oh shit, did I do it? Oh God, I did it, I killed her. I killed her.<br><br>Dom could hear the chatter between the two Raven pilots, but it was just noise, words, sounds without meaning. His body was carrying on without him; he felt like he was coming around from an anesthetic. Whatever instinct had held him together during the mission was now wearing off, leaving behind it a paralyzing horror that drove out everything else except the sheer choking pain from that last look into her eyes.</p><h2>Crab Cake: Turning the Tide Together</h2><p><b><b>Under&nbsp;the sea, a crab follows its&nbsp;heart and its&nbsp;calling, bringing everyone together in the wake of a disaster.

He was especially careful to present new and unfamiliar puzzles that had not been included in such classic collections as those by Sam Loyd and Henry Dudeney. Later, these puzzles were published in book collections, incorporating reader feedback on alternate solutions or interesting generalizations.<br> The present volume contains a rich selection of 70 of the best of these brain teasers, in some cases including references to new developments related to the puzzle. Now enthusiasts can challenge their solving skills and rattle their egos with such stimulating mind-benders as The Returning Explorer, The Mutilated Chessboard, Scrambled Box Tops, The Fork in the Road, Bronx vs. Brooklyn, Touching Cigarettes, and 64 other problems involving logic and basic math. Solutions are included.</p></p><p>Martin Gardner was a renowned author who published over 70 books on subjects from science and math to poetry and religion. He also had a lifelong passion for magic tricks and puzzles. Well known for his mathematical games column in <i>Scientific American</i> and his "Trick of the Month" in <i>Physics Teacher</i> magazine, Gardner attracted a loyal following with his intelligence, wit, and imagination.<p><b>Martin Gardner: A Remembrance<br></b>The worldwide mathematical community was saddened by the death of Martin Gardner on May 22, 2010. Martin was 95 years old when he died, and had written 70 or 80 books during his long lifetime as an author. Martin's first Dover books were published in 1956 and 1957: <i>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery,</i> one of the first popular books on the intellectual excitement of mathematics to reach a wide audience, and <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,</i> certainly one of the first popular books to cast a devastatingly skeptical eye on the claims of pseudoscience and the many guises in which the modern world has given rise to it. Both of these pioneering books are still in print with Dover today along with more than a dozen other titles of Martin's books. They run the gamut from his elementary <i>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing,</i> which has been enjoyed by generations of younger readers since the 1980s, to the more demanding <i>The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings,</i> which Dover published in its final revised form in 2005. </p><p></p><p>To those of us who have been associated with Dover for a long time, however, Martin was more than an author, albeit a remarkably popular and successful one. As a member of the small group of long-time advisors and consultants, which included NYU's Morris Kline in mathematics, Harvard's I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science, and MIT's J. P. Den Hartog in engineering, Martin's advice and editorial suggestions in the formative 1950s helped to define the Dover publishing program and give it the point of view which &#x2014; despite many changes, new directions, and the consequences of evolution &#x2014; continues to be operative today. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Politicians, real-estate agents, used-car salesmen, and advertising copy-writers are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions, but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime. Yet the sad fact is that the history of science swarms with cases of outright fakery and instances of scientists who unconsciously distorted their work by seeing it through lenses of passionately held beliefs." </p><p></p><p>"A surprising proportion of mathematicians are accomplished musicians.

In fact. little mention is made of him there. Yet. despite these seeming limitations. the Church nonetheless possesses an indescribably rich knowledge of St. Joseph and of his cultus. This book will astound most readers both with its scope and with its profundity. Based mainly on Scripture. but supported also by Tradition and the depositions of saints. it is a carefully reasoned analysis of the entirety of that great saint&#39;s role in the history of Salvation and the life of the Church. Includes details about his spiritual life and noble lineage; how he was prefigured in the Old Testament; his relationship to Mary and Jesus; why he has been named by Pope Pius IX &#34;The Patron of the Universal Church;&#34; and so forth.

Why did a top White House official decide to come clean and accept a prison sentence during Watergate? Why did a finance executive turn down millions out of respect for her employer? Why are some willing to risk their futures to uphold principles? What gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe? </p> <p>As these questions suggest, the topic of moral courage is front and center in today's culture. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the U.S. Olympic Committee, abusive priests, cheating students, domestic violence - all these remind us that taking ethical stands should be a higher priority in our culture. Why, when people discern wrongdoing, are they sometimes unready, unable, or unwilling to act? </p> <p>In a book rich with examples, Rushworth Kidder reveals that moral courage is the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics. Defining it as a readiness to endure danger for the sake of principle, he explains that the courage to act is found at the intersection of three elements: action based on core values, awareness of the risks, and a willingness to endure necessary hardship. By exploring how moral courage spurs us to strive for core values, he demonstrates the benefits of ethical action to the individual and to society - and the severe consequences that can result from remaining morally dormant.</p> <p><i>Moral Courage</i> puts indispensable concepts and tools into our hands, equipping us to respond to the increasingly complicated moral challenges we face at work, at home, and in our communities. It enables us to make clear, confident decisions by exploring</p></p><p><p>Rushworth M. Kidder was a professor of English at Wichita State University for ten years before becoming an award-winning columnist and editor at the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>. The author of ten books on subjects ranging from international ethics to the global future, he won the 1980 Explicator Literary Foundation Award for his book on the poetry of E.E. cummings. He and his wife, Elizabeth, live in Lincolnville, Maine.</p>Defining moral courage as "the quality of mind and spirit that enables one to face up to ethical challenges firmly and confidently," Kidder, president of the Institute for Global Ethics, offers a treatise on the "courage to be moral" replete with examples and analysis. He offers a step-by-step guide, including checklists, on how to apply moral values to difficult situations, understand risks (more often career troubles and social ostracism than physical harm) and endure hardships brought on by moral courage itself. He explores how and why people can fail to be morally courageous, and ways that they can learn to behave better, offering anecdotes that range from an investment firm employee choosing to confess a potentially costly mistake to a married couple refusing to let unmarried guests sleep together, despite prevailing cultural norms. The book is weaker on the philosophical side. An extended distinction drawn between physical and moral courage ends up muddy and sometimes patronizing toward those whose courage entails only physical risk; it appears almost as if moral courage were a white-collar courage and physical courage a less exalted blue-collar sort. The analysis of how moral action and values interlock is never thoroughly convincing, since the former seems to cover almost anyone who claims to stand on principle (such as the boss who cut his workers' wages by $3 an hour), but there is enough thoughtfulness here for a substantive introduction to a worthwhile subject. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

RTI is not a series of implementation steps, but rather a way of thinking about how educators can ensure each child receives the time and support needed to achieve success. Understand why bureaucratic, paperwork-heavy, compliance-oriented, test-score-driven approaches fail. Take responsibility for supporting students who struggle due to issues of motivation, attendance, behavior, and English language proficiency. Learn how to create a focused RTI model that works. Based on the four essential guiding principles collective responsibility, concentrated instruction, convergent assessment, and certain access and with their experience working with hundreds of schools in North America, the authors address both academics and behavior in each chapter and provide considerations for district leadership as well. </p><p>Contents </p><p>Preface A Sense of Urgency </p><p>1 A New Way of Thinking </p><p>2 Collective Responsibility: Why Are We Here? </p><p>3 Building Structures for Collaboration </p><p>4 Concentrated Instruction: Where Do We Need to Go? </p><p>5 Convergent Assessment: Where Are We Now? </p><p>6 Creating a System of Interventions </p><p>7 Certain Access: How Do We Get Every Child There? </p><p>Epilogue A New Vision of Special Education</p></p><p>Austin Buffum, EdD, is former senior deputy superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District, which enrolls more than fifty thousand students in South Orange County, California. Dr. Buffum attended the Principals Center at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was greatly inspired by the work of its founder, Roland Barth. He later led Capistrano s K 12 instructional program on an increasingly collaborative path toward operating as a professional learning community (PLC). During this process, thirty-seven of the district s schools were designated California Distinguished Schools, and eleven received National Blue Ribbon recognition. Dr. Buffum is coauthor of Pyramid Response to Intervention: RTI, Professional Learning Communities, and How to Respond When Kids Don t Learn and Generations at School. He also contributed to the anthology The Collaborative Administrator.<p>Mike Mattos is recognized throughout North America for his work in the areas of response to intervention and professional learning communities. He is coauthor of Pyramid Response to Intervention, which was a 2009 finalist for the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers. He also contributed to the anthology The Collaborative Administrator.</p><p>Mike is former principal of both Marjorie Veeh Elementary School and Pioneer Middle School in Tustin, California. In 2004, Marjorie Veeh Elementary, a school with a large population of at-risk youth, won the California Distinguished School and National Title I Achieving School awards.</p><p>A National Blue Ribbon School, Pioneer is one of only thirteen schools in the nation selected by the GE Foundation as a Best-Practice Partner. Based on standardized test scores, Pioneer ranks among the top 1 percent of California middle schools and in 2009 and 2011 was named Orange County s top middle school. For his leadership, Mike was named the Orange County Middle School Administrator of the Year by the Association of California School Administrators.</p><p>Chris Weber, EdD, is a consultant and administrative coach for Chicago Public Schools and the Oakland (California) Unified School District. As principal of R. H. Dana Elementary School in the Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD) in California, together with his staff, Dr. Weber lifted the school to remarkable levels of success. Designated schoolwide Title I, with over 60 percent of all students English learners and Latino and over 75 percent socioeconomically disadvantaged, R. H. Dana consistently exceeded adequate yearly progress (AYP) goals. The school s gains over four years were among the top 1 percent in the state, and it was the first school in the decades-long history of the CUSD to win the State of California s Title I Academic Achievement Award. Under Dr. Weber s leadership, R. H. Dana earned the first California Distinguished School Award in the school s history. After the percentage of students meeting AYP in English and math tripled in four years, the school was named a National Blue Ribbon School.</p><p>Dr. Weber has taught grades K 12 and served as a site administrator for elementary and secondary schools. He was director of instruction for the Garden Grove Unified School District in California, which was the 2004 winner of the prestigious Broad Prize for Urban Education. During this time, all groups of students in the district s forty-seven K 6 schools achieved double-digit AYP gains in mathematics and English language arts.</p><p>Dr. Weber is a coauthor of Pyramid Response to Intervention and Pyramid of Behavior Interventions: Seven Keys to a Positive Learning Environment.</p>In our work with educators around the world, we have found they are hungry for sound information and proven, practical strategies to help them make a greater difference in the lives of their students. Simplifying Response to Intervention: Four Essential Guiding Principles provides just that! Buffum, Mattos, and Weber bring clarity regarding the intent of RTI and specificity regarding the steps educators must take to implement RTI within the continuous improvement framework of the PLC at Work process. The authors also offer an insightful and frank account of things educators must not do if they are truly committed to ensuring high levels of learning for all. But don t let the title fool you - there is nothing simple about the logic in this book. It is a profound must read for educators at all levels! --Richard DuFour and Rebecca DuFour, authors and consultants<br><br>A book whose time has come. This essential reading is refreshing and compelling while profoundly expressing a respectful, systematic approach for improving teaching and learning. The book illuminates the process of tiered instruction and intervention to provide educators with a reflective, proactive process for addressing the needs of every student. --Jane Wagmeister, Ventura County RTI Task Force Chair; Director, Curriculum, Instruction and Continuous Improvement, Ventura County Office of Education, Camarillo, California<br><br>RTI: what is it? It is not a special education initiative but is in fact a general education obligation. Answering the question, How do we respond when learning did not occur?, that is the work. Simplifying Response to Intervention gives a great overview of the structures we need to build and the focus of work we must do daily to assure that every child is given the extra time and support needed to be successful. --Marc Johnson, Superintendent, Sanger Unified School District, California; National Superintendent of the Year 2011</p><h2>Look What I can Do</h2><p><b>Things get out of hand when two buffalo try to outdo each other in this almost-wordless picture book from Jose Arguego.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Look what I can do!&#x201d; &#x201c;I can do it too!&#x201d; And so begins a lively contest between two water buffalo that ends up being a bigger adventure than either of them had imagined!<br> <br>This simple, nearly wordless picture book is one that the very youngest children will be eager to &#x201c;read&#x201d; all by themselves.</p><p>Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey have illustrated many books together&#x2014;he draws the outlines and designs the pages; she paints the illustrations.

Poets from Homer and Virgil to Wordsworth, Whitman, and Thoreau, from Su Tung P'o and Basho to Czeslaw Milosz and W. S. Merwin have celebrated sacred groves, wild woodlands, and bountiful orchards, and the results include some of our most beloved poems. <br><br>Robert Frost's "Birches," Marianne Moore's "The Camperdown Elm," Gerard Manley Hopkins's "Binsey Poplars," and Zbigniew Herbert's "Sequoia" stand tall beside Eugenio Montale's "The Lemon Trees," Yves Bonnefoy's "The Apples," Bertolt Brecht's "The Plum Tree," D. H. Lawrence's "The Almond Tree," and A. E. Housman's "Loveliest of Trees." Whether showing their subjects being planted or felled, cherished or lamented, towering in forests or flowering in backyards, the poems collected here pay lyrical tribute to these majestic beings with whom we share the earth.</p><p>HARRY THOMAS is the editor of <i>Selected Poems of Thomas Hardy</i> (Penguin, 1993) and <i>Montale in English</i> (Penguin, 2002). His poems, translations, essays, and reviews have appeared in dozens of magazines. He is editor in chief of Handsel Books, an imprint of Other Press and an affiliate of W. W. Norton.PREFACE by Stanley Plumly<br> &nbsp;<br> Harry Thomas has arranged his anthology of tree poems as much around complex attitudes toward trees&nbsp;as dramatic evocations of their arboreal being: ranging from the &#x2018;&#x2018;gladness&#x2019;&#x2019; of the fact of them to their natural,&nbsp;named, and significant presences to &#x2013; sadly but beautifully &#x2013; their &#x2018;&#x2018;gladness gone.&#x2019;&#x2019; Which is to say Thomas&#x2019;&nbsp;selection is emotional as well as analytical, political as well as philosophical, as it moves from celebration to&nbsp;meditation, from the reality and imagination of what trees are to a deepening awareness of what their loss&nbsp;means. <br> &nbsp;<br> The range of poets is equally rich in variety, nationality, and history. Though the overall emphasis may be&nbsp;Anglo-American and the living moment especially contemporaneous, the individual poems develop in perspective&nbsp;from Homer&#x2019;s<i> Odyssey</i> and Virgil&#x2019;s <i>Georgics</i> to examples from Matsuo Basho, and Yosa Buson to any number of international figures such as Eugenio Montale, Czeslaw Milosz, Bertolt Brecht, Giorgio Bassani and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, in first-rate translations by Lee Gerlach, Robert Hass, Edwin Morgan, Jamie McKendrick and Paul Muldoon. Indeed, &#x2018;&#x2018;From all these trees,/in the salads, the soup, everywhere,/cherry blossoms fall&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2013; writes the seventeenth-century Japanese poet Basho in the Hass version.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mixture of tradition, innovation, and generation is as exciting as it is informing. You cannot assemble a&nbsp;tree anthology of poems without such classics as Wordsworth&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Nutting&#x2019;&#x2019; or Housman&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Loveliest of&nbsp;Trees&#x2019;&#x2019; or Whitman&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;I Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing&#x2019;&#x2019; or Marianne Moore&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Camperdown&nbsp;Elm.&#x2019;&#x2019; You cannot test the quality of the originality of the poetry without Montale&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Lemon Trees&#x2019;&#x2019; or&nbsp;Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Birch Grove&#x2019;&#x2019; or Rainer Maria Rilke&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Apple Orchard&#x2019;&#x2019; (translated by Seamus&nbsp;Heaney.) You cannot include the present without pairing such poems as Mary Oliver&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Black Walnut&nbsp;Tree&#x2019;&#x2019; with Ellen Bryant Voigt&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Landscape, Dense with Trees&#x2019; or Judith Wright&#x2019;s lyrical &#x2018;&#x2018;Train Journey&#x2019;&#x2019;&nbsp;with her massive meditation &#x2018;&#x2018;The Cedars&#x2019;&#x2019; or James Wright&#x2019;s elegiac &#x2018;&#x2018;To a Blossoming Pear Tree&#x2019;&#x2019; with&nbsp;Marvin Bell&#x2019;s lovely lament &#x2018;&#x2018;These-Green-Going-to- Yellow.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> In terms of tone and poetic temperament, Thomas has effectively exercised his editorial rights to choices&nbsp;that are not only carefully crafted but open-ended in form and ambition; he values discipline and understatement&nbsp;but at the same time admires &#x2018;&#x2018;tree&#x2019;&#x2019; poems that think with their hearts, that enlarge the view with vision. David Ferry&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Everybody&#x2019;s Tree&#x2019;&#x2019; is just that kind of contemporary visionary poem that at some one hundred associative, narrative lines, structured in moments like paragraphs, develops around both personal history and the larger caring time of local community, in a voice at once filled with losses and empathy for those losses. And no poet could be more empathic and expansive than Keats-contemporary John Clare in his &#x2018;&#x2018;sweetest anthem&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;To a Fallen Elm&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2013; its wide, searching lines of direct address may come close to anger but they also abide with love.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is so much to admire here in this beautifully focused gathering of poems, both in the familiar and as&nbsp;discovery. Some of my own favorites are Wordsworth&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Yew Trees,&#x2019;&#x2019; W. C. Williams&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;Burning the Christmas&nbsp;Greens,&#x2019;&#x2019; Jorie Graham&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Tree Surgeons,&#x2019;&#x2019; Robert Graves&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Not Dead,&#x2019;&#x2019; Gerald Stern&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Cemetery of&nbsp;Orange Trees in Crete,&#x2019;&#x2019; James Dickey&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;In the Tree House at Night,&#x2019;&#x2019; and on and on. Because Thomas has&nbsp;arranged his selections around centers of both generosity and gravity he never loses sight of the essential thing: that trees are the great flowers of our world &#x2013; life-givers, life-enhancers, life-poetry. They literally stand at the line between life and death. How many kinds of trees are there, how many purposes, how many differences among the domestic and the wild, the old growth and the new, the abrupt edges and the farmer&#x2019;s field?<br> &nbsp;<br> We love trees for a reason, we cut them down for other reasons, we kill them at our peril. The Ojebway believe that cutting down living trees is like the wounding and killing of animals. The pointless downing of trees is probably worse. For many decades my family&#x2019;s business was the harvesting of trees, a business that would often take my father and his crews out into the Shenandoah for days at a time. This was in the Forties, during and after the war. As a small boy I&#x2019;d sometimes go out with the men for a couple of days, if for nothing else than the feeling of being among the looming hardwoods &#x2013; the big white oaks and scarlet and silver maples and shagbark hickories and massive black walnuts. Just to try to look straight up among them would be to lose your balance, yet their very presences changed the sky and lifted it all somehow.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man-made cutting and trimming was one thing. The other was the natural competition for sunlight and rain and space among the trees themselves, so that there was an inevitable wear and tear and rot and fall that would leave the forest floor covered with ruins, all mixed up in layers of branch and root and debris. Such places in the woods always struck me as sad yet also sacred places, since, when I was old enough to really think about it, they were in-between places where the trees had decided the difference between the past and the future.</p><h2>Deadly Class Volume 5: Carousel</h2><p>It&#x2019;s morning in America, and a new era of DEADLY CLASS begins here!

She's been been kidnapped from her Nile home by the Bad Guy's Big Bad Brother, to be showcased at his Exotic Animal Farm in New Orleans. Bill and Pete get wind of the heist and stow away on the boat transporting Jane Allison. The story gets a little involved: Pete is incarcerated and Bill forms an animal liberation group with some Cajun alligatorsBubba and his cousinswhom he meets in Decatur Bayou. Pete escapes and joins Bill and the new friends in the freeing of Jane Allison and her fellow inmates at the farm. DePaola has laced the story with clever quipsPete, who has been caught and caged on the top floor of a swanky home, says to himself, ``It is lonely up here at the top,'' and Bill's mother says, ``It's times like these that I wish your father was here, and not a suitcase''and his illustrations are highly amusing. It strains the series to work in that New Orleans backdrop, but readers will still be hoping for another glimpseon any continentof Bill and Pete.

The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg's classics <em>Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News,</em> and <em>The Fall of America</em> led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere&#x2014;all leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg's raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world. </p><p>The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume <em>Collected Poems 1947-1980</em>, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: <em>White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death &amp; Fame</em>. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg's artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications. </p></p><p><p>Allen Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1926, and died in New York City in 1997.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Counterculture icon, beat apostle, Buddhist chanter, heir to William Blake, unapologetic explorer of intoxicating substances, world traveler, political protest leader, celebrant of gay sex, chronicler of New Jersey Jewish heritage and of Lower East Side post-hippie bohemians, Ginsberg (1926&#x2013;1997) became by the midpoint of his career the most famous American poet of his era. At first hardworking and tormented, later on a spontaneous, welcoming mentor, the writer who in <i>Howl</i> (1956) "saw the best minds of my generation starving hysterical naked," and who mourned his psychotic mother in the wrenching title poem of <i>Kaddish</i> (1960) kept creating entertaining (if not quite so innovative) poems, for almost three decades after he rose to fame. This first complete collection of Ginsberg's work reproduces his 1980 <i>Collected Poems</i>&#x2014;including all the extensive notes: here are "Howl" and "Kaddish" and the great anti&#x2013;Vietnam War poem "Wichita Vortex Sutra"; here too are the poems about Prague and Cornwall, Benares and Shanghai and the Australian outback, the songs and chants in quatrains (with sheet music) and the unashamed odes to beautiful young men. This complete edition adds <i>White Shroud</i> (1986), <i>Cosmopolitan Greetings</i> (1994) and the aptly titled <i>Death and Fame</i>: <i>Last Poems</i> (2000). A hefty, vivid and important tome, it should remind us just how much Ginsberg accomplished. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

George Bickham, a noted engraver and calligrapher, first compiled this work back in the 1740&#x2019;s, from the best specimens of 24 of the leading calligraphers of his day. Unfortunately, Bickham published his work in 52 separate parts, over a period of eight years. In Bickham&#x2019;s own day it was difficult to get a complete set of the Universal Penman; today, apart from this edition, it is virtually impossible, for most surviving 18th-century copies lack certain rare plates. This Dover edition, however, contains every plate which Bickham engraved, and each is reproduced from an original so remarkably clear that these modern plates are actually better than most 18th-century originals. This book contains more than 210 full-page plates, each crammed full of beautiful and interesting material. To list only part of its contents: � Over 125 pictorial scenes, clear copperplates of drinking scenes, family scenes, commerce, rustic festivities, duels, more. � Over 200 script pictures, male and female heads, busts, cherubs, griffins, birds, fish, etc. � 19 complete alphabets: round hand, round text, Old English, florid, foliated, and others. � 275 lettered specimens, overlaid with fine flourishes, swirls, spirals, featherings, volutes, etc. � Over 100 panels, frames, cartouches, and other effects Over 950 lettered specimens, with thousands of words that can be lifted right off for reproduction. Individual items in this book are permission-free, and may be used (up to ten items per use) without permission, payment, or credit line. Calligraphers find Bickham the best source for English round-handwriting; commercial artists, advertising directors, and designers all find Bickham first-rate as a source for immediately usable pictures and script that suggests antiquity, quality, and reliability. Craftspeople have found it rich in unusual ideas and motifs, while libraries and art historians find it a wonderful collection of 18th-century pictures illustrating art-life.</p><p></p><h2>Roadside Geology of Missouri</h2><p>The Show-Me State has plenty of geology to show, including the biggest entry room of any cave in North America, the largest lead deposit in the United States, and the only exposures in the Midwest of a large province of 1.48-billion-year-old granite and rhyolite. Geologic history is still being made here, too. In 1811 and 1812, an unprecedented series of magnitude 7 and 8 earthquakes rocked southeast Missouri, liquefying the floodplain sediments and temporarily blocking the flow of the Mississippi River. In <i>Roadside Geology of Missouri</i>, author Charlie Spencer shows you around the state&#x2015;from the flat, glaciated plains in the north to the knobs of rhyolite in the St. Francois Mountains in the south, and from the earthquake-formed sand boils on the Mississippi floodplain in the southeast to the layers of coal, shale, sandstone, and limestone on the Springfield Plateau and Osage Plains in the west. With this book as your guide, find out where dinosaur fossils have been found in Missouri, why caves and springs seem to pop up nearly everywhere, and which of Missouri&#x2019;s mysterious structures were formed by meteorite impacts.</p><p>Charles G. Spencer grew up in Lee&#x2019;s Summit, Missouri, and became interested in geology while walking along the railroad tracks near his home, collecting interesting rocks from the gravel ballast.

As a Commonwealth, the island enjoys limited autonomy over local matters, but the U.S. has dominated it militarily, politically, and economically for much of its recent history. Though they are U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans do not have their own voting representatives in Congress and cannot vote in presidential elections (although they are able to participate in the primaries). The island's status is a topic of perennial debate, both within and beyond its shores. In recent months its colossal public debt has sparked an economic crisis that has catapulted it onto the national stage and intensified the exodus to the U.S., bringing to the fore many of the unresolved remnants of its colonial history. <br><br><em>Puerto Rico: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> provides a succinct, authoritative introduction to the Island's rich history, culture, politics, and economy. The book begins with a historical overview of Puerto Rico during the Spanish colonial period (1493-1898). It then focuses on the first five decades of the U.S. colonial regime, particularly its efforts to control local, political, and economic institutions as well as to "Americanize" the Island's culture and language. Jorge Duany delves into the demographic, economic, political, and cultural features of contemporary Puerto Rico-the inner workings of the Commonwealth government and the island's relationship to the United States. Lastly, the book explores the massive population displacement that has characterized Puerto Rico since the mid-20th century.<br><br>Despite their ongoing colonial dilemma, Jorge Duany argues that Puerto Ricans display a strong national identity as a Spanish-speaking, Afro-Hispanic-Caribbean nation. While a popular tourist destination, few beyond its shores are familiar with its complex history and diverse culture. Duany takes on the task of educating readers on the most important facets of the unique, troubled, but much beloved <em>isla del encanto</em>.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jorge Duany</strong> is the Director of the Cuban Research Institute and Professor of Anthropology at Florida International University. He has published extensively on migration, ethnicity, race, nationalism, and transnationalism in the Hispanic Caribbean and the United States. He is the author, coauthor, or editor of 20 books, including several works about Puerto Rico.<br><br>"This is a very useful book, a manual that offers a comprehensive view of what Puerto Rico is and has been: its history, circumstances, and problems....It is also book written in a simple way and easy to understand, which serves as a base and introduction to the topic for those who know nothing about our country."--Carmen Dolores Hernndez, <em>El Nuevo Da</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Stig &amp; Tilde: Leader of the Pack: Stig &amp; Tilde 2 (Stig and Tilde)</h2><p><b>In their second adventure, Stig and Tilde once again find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious island.</b><br><br>This time, after their shipwreck, Stig &amp; Tilde are welcomed by a pack of feral wolves!

The branding they employ may contain complex systems of meaning and emotion; it conveys the group's beliefs and capabilities. Branding Terror is the first comprehensive survey of the visual identity of the world&#x2019;s major terrorist organizations, from al-Qaeda and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to the Tamil Tigers.

Author Neil H. Leash has drawn together the messages of LDS General Authorities given to the Saints concerning the essential need for food storage in preparation for tribulations. He focuses on crystallizing moments sudden events that radically changed mankind s actions and directions during the past century and shows that similar events can be expected in the future. The degree of our preparation will equal the extent of our obedience, which will determine the measure of our peace of mind, writes the author.

In addition to answering questions such as Where should Latter-day Saints live during times of tribulation? and Should we share our food storage? this important book offers a brief review of monetary history, comments on the human factors of economics, and basic food storage quantities. In no other single volume can you get prophetic guidance that gives you the basic principles of food storage and helps you gain for yourself and your family the peace of mind you ve been seeking.</p><p>Neil H.

In <em>Water To Wine</em> Brian Zahnd tells his story of disenchantment with pop Christianity and his search for a more substantive faith.</p> <br> <p>&#x201c;I was halfway to ninety&#x2014;midway through life&#x2014;and I had reached a full-blown crisis. Call it garden variety mid-life crisis if you want, but it was something more. You might say it was a theological crisis, though that makes it sound too cerebral. The unease I felt came from a deeper place than a mental file labeled &#x201c;theology.&#x201d; I was wrestling with the uneasy feeling that the faith I had built my life around was somehow deficient. Not wrong, but lacking. It seemed watery, weak. In my most honest moments I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice that the faith I knew seemed to lack the kind of robust authenticity that made Jesus so fascinating. And I had always been utterly fascinated by Jesus. What I knew was that the Jesus I believed in warranted a better Christianity than what I was familiar with. I was in Cana and the wine had run out. I needed Jesus to perform a miracle.&#x201d; &#x2013;<em>Water To Wine</em></p></p><p>Brian Zahnd is the founder and lead pastor, of Word of Life Church in St. Joseph, Missouri.

Schulz&#x2019;s cartooning has never been more expressive, and his sense of humor never more unencumbered by formula or tradition. In this volume, Charlie Brown gets caught up in a fake celebrity autographs racket, Rerun gets accused of sexual harassment, the infamous &#x201c;Crybaby&#x201d; Boobie returns, Snoopy&#x2019;s brothers go on a quest to find Mickey Mouse, Snoopy gets his driver&#x2019;s license, Rerun continues to pursue the underground arts, Linus starts his own church of Great Pumpkin believers and is declared a false prophet, and other surprises that make these last few years of Peanuts ripe for reconsideration. This is the 24th volume (of 25) of the bestselling series collecting every single one of the 18,000-plus strips created by Schulz from 1950-2000. Also available is the holiday boxed set, offering Vols. 23 and 24</p><p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Paul Feig</strong> was born in Michigan. He co-created the seminal television series <em>Freaks and Geeks</em>, directed the blockbuster hit Bridesmaids in 2011, and has been nominated for five Emmy awards. Feig produced the upcoming <em>Peanuts</em> animated film and is helming the new <em>Ghostbusters</em> movie.</p>&#x201c;...[T]here was still&nbsp;<em>so much</em>&nbsp;Schulz had to offer in the twilight of his career. ...[H]e still had the spark that made him Sparky, and was still capable of producing&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>&nbsp;strips...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Parker, <em>ComicsAlliance</em></strong></p><h2>A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing: A Novel</h2><p><b>The dazzling, fearless debut novel that won the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction and the book the <i>New York Times</i> hails as &#x201c;a future classic&#x201d;.</b><br><br>In scathing, furious, unforgettable prose, Eimear McBride tells the story of a young girl&#x2019;s devastating adolescence as she and her brother, who suffers from a brain tumor, struggle for a semblance of normalcy in the shadow of sexual abuse, denial, and chaos at home. Plunging readers inside the psyche of a girl isolated by her own dangerously confusing sexuality, pervading guilt, and unrelenting trauma, McBride&#x2019;s writing carries echoes of Joyce, O&#x2019;Brien, and Woolf. <i>A Girl is a Half-formed Thing</i> is a revelatory work of fiction, a novel that instantly takes its place in the canon.</p><p>Award-winning author <b>Eimear McBride</b> was born in 1976 and grew up in Ireland. At twenty-seven she wrote&nbsp;<i>A Girl is a Half-formed Thing</i>&nbsp;and spent just under a decade trying to have it published.

Ach she's not able. She said that alright before. And can the doctor not give her something, just to relieve her a bit? You must be worn out. Will you have a cup of tea?</p><h2>Clean Language:Revealing Metaphors and Opening Minds</h2><p>What Is Clean Language? Clean Language was first developed in the 1980s and 90s by psychotherapist David Grove as he sought to find respectful and effective ways to work with trauma victims. The approach he devised was based on a new type of questioning (and listening) that was rooted in honoring the client&#39;s language rather than paraphrasing it, reserving advice rather than pushing it, and cleaning up his own communications with respect to assumptions and metaphors. What David Grove learned was that these adjustments allowed his clients to discover and build on the metaphors that were meaningful to them. Once established, they could explore that meaning, experience it in their own ways, learn from it, heal, and move forward. David Grove called his questioning approach Clean Language untainted by assumption or metaphor. Inspired by the effectiveness of David Grove&#39;s work, James Lawley and Penny Tompkins studied the approach, eventually codifying it, and then expanding upon it. Now, authors Sullivan and Rees and take this revolutionary way of communicating completely out of the closet, introducing the concepts to the broad range of helping professional (from psychotherapist to organizational coach) as well as interested laypeople. Clean Language (Clean, for short) allows access to the deepest levels of people s communications so that the real issues are revealed early and real helping strategies can be created to meet them. When the client is invited to find the solution, then time isn&#39;t wasted in the vain attempts to convince, cajole, or coerce. The basic perspective is straightforward. You should keep your opinions and advice to yourself. You should Listen attentively and ask clean questions to explore metaphors. You should listen to the answers and then ask more Clean questions about they ve said There are just a dozen key Clean questions, and when combined with the words offered by the person being questioned, they become part of a flexible, multipurpose toolkit. The possibility of positive change is just a natural part of the process nobody forcing it, nobody being forced. It s as natural as using clean language.</p><p>Wendy Sullivan is an international trainer of Clean Language and Symbolic Modelling who has worked extensively with the founders of that field. Judy Rees is a certified Clean Facilitator an expert in Clean Language and Symbolic Modelling, and runs a London-based Clean Language Company with Wendy Sullivan.<i>Clean Language</i> is one of the most fundamental and important tools available in NLP and coaching. This book stands out for the clarity of it's explanations and makes Clean Language commonsense. This book is to be used as the communicators bible. --Toby McCartney, WestOne Training, Author of Mastering Memory<br><br>In their excellent book, <i>Clean Language: Revealing Metaphors and Opening Minds</i>, Wendy Sullivan and Judy Rees give an in-depth yet highly accessible route-map for understanding the metaphorical nature of human perception, and for developing powerful skills for working in the domain of personal metaphor. While I expected the subject to be covered in masterful detail, what I didn't anticipate was such a cogent and useful introduction to the role metaphors play in perception. Wendy and Judy present this material in a way that's easy to grasp, and pull together understandings and realizations that you would otherwise have to piece together from diverse sources. Of course, the core of the book is the application of the clean language questions. There are numerous exercises for developing intuitions about what to ask when, and for what purpose.

Judy, who became the war's only official canine POW, was a fiercely loyal dog who sensed danger--warning her fellow prisoners of imminent attacks and protecting them from brutal beatings. Frank and Judy's friendship, an unbreakable bond forged in the worst circumstances, is one of the great recently unearthed stories of World War II.<br> <br>As they discover Frank and Judy's story in this specially adapted text, young readers will also learn about key World War II moments through informative and engaging sidebars, maps, photographs, and a timeline.</p><p>Robert Weintraub is a frequent contributor to the <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Slate </em>and the author of the acclaimed books <em>The House That Ruth Built</em>, <em>The Victory Season</em>, and <em>No Better Friend</em>.Gr 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Weintraub's middle grade adaptation of his adult book is an almost unbelievable tale of animal survival and loyalty amid the horrors of World War II. Born in Shanghai, China, Judy the purebred pointer dog began her military career when she was adopted by a group of English sailors who took her onboard a gunboat and eventually moved her to Singapore just as World War II reached the Pacific. Judy survived sinking ships, torpedoed boats, and life on a desert island before following her human companions to a Japanese internment camp, where she met Frank Williams, a radarman in the Royal Air Force. The friendship between the two, as well as Judy's encouragement and protection of other men interned at the camp, helped raise spirits in a desperate situation. Readers will appreciate this work, which has been lovingly and engagingly adapted by Weintraub. Through accessible language, the author makes it clear that he is inferring many aspects of the narrative. Sidebars on topics such as the Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Britain, and post-traumatic stress disorder among soldiers add context. Photographs are frequent, well chosen, and clearly captioned. A thorough notes section (present in the adult version) is left out. VERDICT An enormously readable account of animal and human companionship and survival; recommended for budding historians and fans of survival stories.&#x2014;Kristy Pasquariello, Wellesley Free Library, MA</p><h2>The New Stokes Field Guide to Birds: Western Region</h2><p>The culmination of many years of research, observation, and study, the THE NEW STOKES FIELD GUIDE TO BIRDS: Western Region is factually, visually, and organizationally superior to any other photographic field guide available. <br> This easy-to-use guide features 636 North American bird species and more than 2,000 stunning color photographs.

It&#x2019;s that serious one that makes my bottom lip wobble. &#x201c;I need you to go back inside, sit down in our booth, and ask that nice waitress for another piece of that pecan pie you like so much,&#x201d; he says slowly, evenly.<br> <br>I swallow back my tears. &#x201c;Alone?&#x201d;<br> <br>His face tightens, like he&#x2019;s mad. &#x201c;Only for a little bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then you&#x2019;ll come in?&#x201d;<br> <br>He squeezes his eyes shut and I&#x2019;m afraid I just made him really angry, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;ve never gone anywhere alone. I&#x2019;m only five. &#x201c;Remember that Daddy loves you, baby girl. Now go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stifling back a sob, I slide along the old bench seat and push the heavy old Ford truck door open.<br> <br>&#x201c;Reesie,&#x201d; Daddy calls out as my red shoes hit the sidewalk.<br> <br>Turning, I see his hand wiping at something on his cheek before he gives me a wink and a smile. The truck door makes a loud bang as I swing it tight. Holding my breath, I climb the steps and push as hard as I can against the diner door, the jangle of the bell ringing in my ears. I dart across the black-and-white checkered floor and climb into our booth&#x2014;the one we were sitting in before Daddy called Mommy; it still has our dishes on the table&#x2014;just in time to see the taillights of Daddy&#x2019;s truck disappear.<br> <br>When the nice waitress with the big hair comes by, I tell her my daddy will be here soon and I order that piece of chocolate pecan pie with a please and thank you. I sit in that booth and gobble it up, thinking how lucky I am to get two pieces in one night.<br> <br>And I wait.<br> <br>With my chin resting on my palm, tucked into the corner of the booth, I stare out that window, watching for the familiar blue truck to reappear, checking the door every time that bell jangles. When the kind policeman sits down across from me and asks me where my daddy is, I tell him he&#x2019;ll be here soon.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no kind policeman to comfort me now. No nice lady bringing me a piece of chocolate pecan pie to combat the sourness in my mouth. But at least this time I wasn&#x2019;t abandoned.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m reminded of that the second I see my stepfather&#x2019;s face through the small glass window in the door.<br> <br>His salt-and-pepper hair is more salt than pepper and he&#x2019;s gained at least ten pounds around his waist since I last saw him&#x2014;nine years ago&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s no mistaking Jack Warner. I don&#x2019;t think he recognizes me, though. The way his steely blue eyes wander over my violet hair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my piercings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the giant &#x201c;Jared&#x201d; tattoo that coils around my right shoulder, I think he&#x2019;s wondering if the police officer led him into the wrong room.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m lucky that I&#x2019;m even in a room this time. Normally they throw you into a holding cell or make you sit in an uncomfortable chair next to a drunk named Seth who stinks of malt scotch and body odor. I&#x2019;m pretty sure the female arresting officer felt sorry for me. By the lethal glare she threw at Jared and Caroline as I was escorted out of Lina&#x2019;s apartment, past their apartment door, on my way to the cruiser, the officer wasn&#x2019;t impressed with what she&#x2019;d heard of the situation.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t hear it from me, of course. Growing up around lawyers, I&#x2019;ve learned not to say a word to the police without one present. It was my best friend and next-door neighbor, Lina, who declared that the apartment I trashed earlier today is still technically mine&#x2014;even if my name isn&#x2019;t on the lease&#x2014;and that they should be arresting the thieving, heartless bitch who stole my husband.<br> <br>Unfortunately, I&#x2019;m the only one sitting here now.<br> <br>I hold my breath as I watch Jack take a seat, adjusting his slightly rumpled suit jacket on his large frame as he tries to get comfortable in the hard plastic chair. It&#x2019;s ironic&#x2014;in this moment, it feels like he&#x2019;s both an integral part of my childhood and a complete stranger.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t believe I called him.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t believe he actually came.<br> <br>With a heavy sigh, he finally murmurs, &#x201c;Reese&#x2019;s Pieces.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s looking down at me the same way he did when I got caught rearranging the letters of a Baptist church sign to read something no nine-year-old girl&#x2014;or twenty-year-old, for that matter&#x2014;should have in her vocabulary. Despite the severe strain in our once close relationship, warmth immediately spreads through my chest. I haven&#x2019;t heard that nickname in years. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. destruction of private property?&#x201d;<br> <br>I guess the cops filled him in. &#x201c;I prefer to call it artistic expression.&#x201d; The canvas included Caroline&#x2019;s prissy clothes, her pretentious throw cushions, and that damn pornographic picture of them hanging over our bed. &#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; I raise my hands, stained in crimson, and offer in a deadpan tone, &#x201c;they can&#x2019;t prove it was me.&#x201d; When Lina found me sitting quietly in the dim kitchen light of her apartment, where I&#x2019;ve been staying for the past two weeks, she let out a single yelp before realizing that I hadn&#x2019;t turned into a homicidal maniac and was in fact covered in red paint. I probably should have made the cops&#x2019; job harder and showered before they arrived.<br> <br>A tiny sad smile creeps over his face. I wonder if my attempt at humor adequately hides the crushing heartbreak and rejection that I&#x2019;m drowning in after finding out my husband was having an affair with his high school sweetheart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I phoned Barry on my way here. Sounds like you&#x2019;ve kept him busy these past few years.&#x201d; By his clenching jaw, I see that wasn&#x2019;t an easy call for Jack to make, even nine years later. Not surprising. Friends since they could barely walk, Jack and Barry were once equity partners together in his law firm. Until Barry had an affair with Jack&#x2019;s wife.<br> <br>My mother.<br> <br>All relationships instantly dissolved in a bath of bitterness that obviously hasn&#x2019;t fully drained yet. Glancing at his hand, I can&#x2019;t help but notice the absence of a wedding ring. I guess he hasn&#x2019;t remarried. After what my mother put him through, I don&#x2019;t blame him.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I understand why you called me now. You didn&#x2019;t have a choice, did you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I admit, focusing on the stars and circles I&#x2019;m finger-drawing over the table&#x2019;s cold metal surface. Barry is a high-priced, successful criminal lawyer who has gotten his unruly stepdaughter out of more than one debacle. The last incident was on my eighteenth birthday when I decided it would be funny to go retro and moon cars.<br> <br>One of those cars was a police cruiser.<br> <br>The cop was an uptight prick.<br> <br>And I was drunk.<br> <br>After helping me avoid indecent exposure and underage public drunkenness charges, Barry announced that my juvenile record was sealed, I was now an adult, and he was officially washing his hands of me. Three months later, when my mother left him for husband number four, it really became official.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised Annabelle&#x2019;s new husband didn&#x2019;t want this swept under the rug quickly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t phone Annabelle. I don&#x2019;t want her to know about this.&#x201d; I stopped calling her &#x201c;Mom&#x201d; when I was eight. We both agreed it wasn&#x2019;t fitting for a woman whose true passions lay in exclusive club status and dirty martinis.<br> <br>My doodling finger freezes suddenly. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t phone her, did you?&#x201d; That would be like handing her torpedoes for an effective insult air strike. She had called it after all. She&#x2019;d said I didn&#x2019;t have what it took to keep my &#x201c;blue-collar pretty-boy&#x201d; husband happy for long.<br> <br>Jack chuckles softly, though there&#x2019;s no mirth in it. &#x201c;No, I definitely did not phone her. What would I tell her, anyway? You weren&#x2019;t exactly informative on the phone. Sounds like you&#x2019;re in some hot water, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>My sigh of relief slides out and I&#x2019;m back to doodling. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they tell me.&#x201d; When the cops started throwing around words like &#x201c;larceny&#x201d; and &#x201c;threats of bodily harm&#x201d;&#x2014;things that sounded excessive and unfitting, but permanently damaging to my fresh and clean adult record should they stick&#x2014;I knew I wasn&#x2019;t going to talk my way out of this one. It didn&#x2019;t help that I used the picture of Caroline for target practice during my rampage, leaving a pair of scissors strategically placed through her eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing you still have that same law firm. You were easy to find.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack folds his arms over his chest and regards me with an unreadable face. A tiny part of me&#x2014;the angry little girl lost somewhere inside&#x2014;is ready to burst, to demand, &#x201c;How could you have left me? I know why you left my mom, but how could you have shoved me out of your life so easily, too? I didn&#x2019;t cheat on you!&#x201d; But I bite my bottom lip. Pissing off the one person who can help me right now wouldn&#x2019;t be smart. And I need to be smart.<br> <br>Finally Jack leans back in his chair and says, &#x201c;Okay, Reese. Start from the beginning and let&#x2019;s see how we can solve this.&#x201d;<br> <br>I press my lips together to keep from smiling. Not because this is amusing. It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;ve been here before. This really is starting to feel like days long since lost, when we&#x2019;d meet up in the kitchen around midnight&#x2014;after Annabelle had gone to sleep, when Jack was finally home from work&#x2014;to contemplate my latest mischief over bowls of ice cream. He&#x2019;s even adopted the same hypnotic tone that always got me talking when my teachers, my guidance counselor, or anyone else really, couldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m pretty sure he uses it on all of his clients.<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, after I&#x2019;ve given him a rundown of my situation, I hear his disappointed sigh. &#x201c;Working in a pet shop, Reese?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not anymore.&#x201d; After leaving work early with the flu and coming home to the big discovery of Jared and her in the shower&#x2014;oddly enough, the more it replays in my mind, the more it begins to resemble the shower scene from Scarface&#x2014;I spent a week in Lina&#x2019;s bed, heavily sedated with Jim Beam and Nyquil. My boss fired me over the phone.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>&#x201c;And eloping in Vegas with a guy? At nineteen years old? After knowing him for six weeks?&#x201d; I know that the chuckle that fills the room now isn&#x2019;t directed at me, even before his words confirm it; Jack&#x2019;s laughing at the irony of it all. &#x201c;And you were always so adamant that you&#x2019;d never get married.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have no answer to that, except a quiet &#x201c;I loved him,&#x201d; as the painful knot forms in my throat, as I fight the sob from tearing out of me. I did. I think I still do, despite how much Jared has hurt me. Since that day eight months ago when I stepped out of my best friend Lina&#x2019;s apartment and quite literally ran into her neighbor, a reincarnation of a mint-eyed Greek demigod, I knew that I had met my soul mate. Fireworks exploded, lightning struck, electricity coursed. All that love-at-first-sight bullshit that I didn&#x2019;t believe in&#x2014;I instantly became a poster child for it. Common sense flew out the window with a cement block tied to its ankle.<br> <br>Jared said he felt it, too.<br> <br>And now, after six months of marital bliss, without a single warning sign, he&#x2019;s back with her.<br> <br>That rotten illness festering inside me enflames with the thought, the humiliating reality a burn that doesn&#x2019;t want to subside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, Reese. I know you&#x2019;ve always had a wild streak in you, even as a little girl. These choices you&#x2019;ve made since I saw you last, though,&#x201d; his head is shaking, &#x201c;possession of marijuana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. trespassing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. underage drinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a fistfight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really that big a deal. A lot of people drink and smoke pot in high school,&#x201d; I argue, adding, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just the one who kept getting caught.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drag racing?&#x201d; He stares at me questioningly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those were derby cars and that was totally blown out of proportion,&#x201d; I clarify.<br> <br>Jack slides his glasses off and gives his face a rough rub, looking exhausted. It&#x2019;s a four-hour drive from Miami to Jacksonville and he arrived here five hours after I called, meaning he pretty much dropped everything to come. I can&#x2019;t help but wonder why he&#x2019;d do that.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least I didn&#x2019;t get knocked up,&#x201d; I joke.<br> <br>By the look of exasperation he shoots me, he doesn&#x2019;t find that remotely funny. &#x201c;I had hoped you were too smart to get into this kind of trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess even smart girls can make a clusterfuck of their lives, can&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I mutter, though his words sting.<br> <br>Because they&#x2019;re true.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a long pause, where Jack&#x2019;s mouth twists in thought as he regards me. &#x201c;What are you going to do with yourself now, Reese? How are you going to make up for this?&#x201d; When I was little, Jack always asked me for suggestions as to how I should be punished for my various childish misdemeanors. I think it was his way of getting me to agree on the outcome without looking like the harsh stepfather. I was pretty good at coming up with suitable penances and it was definitely preferable to sitting in a chair while my mother shrieked about what an embarrassment I was to her, the gin sloshing out of her martini glass with her mad hand gesticulations.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m not a little kid anymore and Jack&#x2019;s not asking me to come up with a suitable punishment. He&#x2019;s asking me how I&#x2019;m going to fix my life.<br> <br>All I have for him is a defeated shrug.<br> <br>Because that&#x2019;s how I feel right now. Defeated. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Get another job, I guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about college?&#x201d;<br> <br>The eye roll happens before I can stop myself. Jack always hated my eye rolls. &#x201c;My transcripts aren&#x2019;t exactly going to woo the administrative offices.&#x201d; Neither will the private school expulsion, earned when I broke into a teacher&#x2019;s office and stole a midterm exam.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you couldn&#x2019;t do the work?&#x201d; My arched brow answers him. &#x201c;Because you didn&#x2019;t do the work,&#x201d; he answers for himself, shaking his head, his face a mask of extreme disappointment. &#x201c;Is this how you want to live your life? In and out of police cars? Working minimum-wage jobs? In unstable relationships?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does anybody ever really want that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s right. I was smart. Some may say I&#x2019;m still smart. But I&#x2019;ve made so many wrong turns along the way, I don&#x2019;t know how many right ones it will take to course-correct.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s even possible.<br> <br>I sit in silence, listening to the monotonous tick-tick-tick of the second hand on the wall clock above, watching Jack as he spends an exorbitant amount of time playing with the gold Rolex on his wrist, his breaths deep and ragged. I don&#x2019;t know that I can count on him. I mean, he forgot about me once. Looking at the twenty-year-old version of who he once knew, he&#x2019;s probably ready to stamp &#x201c;lost cause&#x201d; across my forehead.<br> <br>And then he settles those kind gray eyes on me. &#x201c;I honestly didn&#x2019;t know what to expect when I arrived, but I had a long car ride up to think about it.&#x201d; Folding his hands together on the table in front of him, a stern expression settles over his face. &#x201c;I have a proposition. It comes with conditions, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>A small exhale escapes me as I c...</p><h2>Balance Point (Star Wars, The New Jedi Order #6)</h2><p><b><i>In the aftermath of one tragedy,<br>will a young Jedi&#x2019;s search for redemption<br>lead to yet another?</i></b><br><br>There is no place else to channel the flood of refugees fleeing the murderous Yuuzhan Vong but the overcrowded planet Duro, poisoned by centuries of technological excess.

Under a translucent gray dome, tension wrapped around him like a Zharan glass-snake&#x2014;invisible, but so palpable through the Force that he could almost feel its coils constrict.<br><br>Something was about to happen. He could feel it coming when he listened through the Force. Something vital, but . . .<br><br>What?<br><br>A Ryn female&#x2014;velvet-furred with a spiked mane, her tail and forearm bristles graying with age&#x2014;stood talking to Jacen&#x2019;s dad, Han Solo.<br><br>&#x201c;Those are our caravan ships,&#x201d; she bellowed, waving her hands. &#x201c;Ours.&#x201d; She snorted, and the breath whonked through four holes in her chitinous beak.<br><br>Han swung around, narrowly missing Jacen with his left arm. &#x201c;And right at this moment, we can&#x2019;t afford to take them offworld to run systems checks. You&#x2019;ve been in a restricted area, Mezza.&#x201d;<br><br>Splashes of red-orange fur highlighted Mezza&#x2019;s soft taupe coat. Her blue tail tip trembled, a gesture Jacen had learned to interpret as impatience.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;ve been in the ship lot,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s never been a security fence Ryn couldn&#x2019;t get inside, and those are our caravan ships. Ours.&#x201d; She tapped her threadbare vest, which covered an ample chest. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t tell me to trust you, Captain. We do. It&#x2019;s SELCORE we don&#x2019;t trust. SELCORE, and the people up there.&#x201d; She waved her arm skyward.<br><br>Han&#x2019;s mouth twitched, and seventeen-year-old Jacen could almost feel him trying not to laugh. Jacen&#x2019;s dad could sympathize with refugees making unofficial reconnaissances, especially on board their own ships. But Han was in charge, now. Instead of showing his amusement, he was supposed to enforce SELCORE regulations&#x2014;publicly, at least, for the sake of a few juvenile offenders. He and Mezza would undoubtedly settle the real issues later, in private.<br><br>So Han plunged back into the argument.<br><br>Jacen watched the show, trying to pick up one more piece of the puzzle he felt in every cell of his being. Trained as a Jedi and unusually perceptive, he could tell that the Force was about to move. To shift.<br><br>This time, he didn&#x2019;t dare miss the clues.<br><br>His right cheekbone twinged. He touched it self-consciously, then swept his hair back from his face. It needed cutting, but no one here cared what he looked like. His legs were still growing, his shoulders broadening. He felt like an awkward hybrid of trained Jedi and barely grown boy.<br><br>He leaned against his hut&#x2019;s outer wall and stared out over his new home. The dome had been engineered by SELCORE, the New Republic Senate Select Committee for Refugees, to hold a thousand settlers. Naturally, twelve hundred had been squeezed in. Besides these outcast Ryn, there were several hundred desperate humans, delicate Vors, Vuvrians with their enormous round heads&#x2014;and one young Hutt.<br><br>And the relentless Yuuzhan Vong kept sweeping across the galaxy, destroying whole worlds, enslaving or sacrificing planetary populations. Lush Ithor, lawless Ord Mantell, and Obroa-skai with its fabulous libraries&#x2014;all had fallen to the merciless invaders. Hutt space and the Mid Rim worlds along the Corellian Run were under attack. If the Yuuzhan Vong could be stopped, the New Republic hadn&#x2019;t figured out how.<br><br>Han Solo stood with his left hand on his hip, arguing with Mezza, who led the larger of two Ryn clan remnants, but keeping one eye on the transgressors, a group of youths about Jacen&#x2019;s age, with fading juvenile stripes on their cheeks. The Ryn clans occupied one of Settlement Thirty-two&#x2019;s three wedge-shaped arrays of blue-roofed huts. The synthplas dome arched overhead, as gray as the polluted mists that swirled outside.<br><br>Jacen had been blessed&#x2014;or cursed&#x2014;with a sensitivity that he once hid behind labored jokes, and he did find it easy to see both sides of almost any argument. Part of his job here was to help his dad negotiate. Han tended to cut to solutions, instead of listening to both parties&#x2019; points of view. Han had chased the Ryn over half the New Republic, trying to gather his new friend Droma&#x2019;s invasion-scattered clanmates. As world after world closed its doors to refugees, the Ryn had been beggared, duped, and betrayed. They&#x2019;d taken terrible losses. They needed a sponsor.<br><br>So a reluctant Han Solo registered with the burgeoning Select Committee for Refugees. &#x201c;Just long enough to settle them someplace.&#x201d; That was how he explained it to Jacen, anyway.<br><br>Jacen had fled here from Coruscant. Two months ago, the New Republic had called him and his brother Anakin to Centerpoint Station, the massive hyperspace repulsor and gravity lens in the Corellian system. There&#x2019;d been hope that Anakin, who had activated Centerpoint once before, could enable it again. Military advisers had hoped to lure the Yuuzhan Vong into attacking Corellia, and they meant to use Centerpoint as an interdiction field, to trap the enemy inside Corellian space&#x2014;and then wipe them out. Even Uncle Luke hoped the station might be used only in its shielding capacity, not as a weapon.<br><br>The New Republic might never recover from the catastrophe that followed.<br><br>Jacen could see stress in his dad&#x2019;s lined face and his labored stride, and in the gray growing into his hair. Even after all these years of hobnobbing with bureaucrats and tolerating his wife&#x2019;s protocol droid, patience clearly wasn&#x2019;t his strong suit.<br><br>Standing on the beaten-dust lane outside the Solos&#x2019; hut, Mezza&#x2019;s opposing clan leader twisted his own tail between strong hands. The fur on Romany&#x2019;s forearms, and the tip of his tail, stood out like bleached bristles.<br><br>&#x201c;So your clan,&#x201d; Han said, pointing at Romany, &#x201c;thinks your clan&#x201d;&#x2014;pointing now at Mezza&#x2014;&#x201c;is likely to hijack our transport ships and strand everybody else here on Duro? Is that it?&#x201d;<br><br>Someone at the back of Romany&#x2019;s group shouted, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t put it past them, Solo.&#x201d;<br><br>Another Ryn stepped forward. &#x201c;We were better off in the Corporate Sector, dancing for credits and telling fortunes. At least there we had our own ships. We could hide our children from poisoned air. And even more poisonous . . . words.&#x201d;<br><br>Han stuck his hands into his dusty coverall pockets and caught Jacen&#x2019;s glance. Jacen could almost look him in the eye, nowadays.<br><br>&#x201c;Any suggestions?&#x201d; Han muttered.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just venting their frustrations now,&#x201d; Jacen observed.<br><br>He glanced up. The gray synthplas dome over their heads had been imported in accordion folds and unfurled over three arched metal struts. The refugees were reinforcing it with webs of native rock fiber, roughly half the colony working double shifts to strengthen the dome and their prefab huts. The other half labored outside, at a pit-mine &#x201c;reservoir&#x201d; and water purification site assigned by SELCORE.<br><br>Abruptly Han flung up an arm and shouted, &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen spun around in time to see one young male Ryn somersault out of Romany&#x2019;s group and crouch for fisticuffs. Two from Mezza&#x2019;s group body-blocked him with surprising grace. Within seconds, Han was wading into an out-and-out melee that looked too graceful to actually endanger anyone. Ryn were natural gymnasts. They swung their opponents by their bristled tails, hooting through their beaks like a flock of astromech droids. They almost seemed to be dancing, playing, releasing their tensions. Jacen opened his mouth to say, Don&#x2019;t stop them. They need to cut loose.<br><br>At that moment, he collapsed, his chest flashing with fire as if he&#x2019;d been torn open. His legs burned so fiercely he could almost feel hot shrapnel. The pain blasted down his legs, then into his ears.<br><br>Jaina?<br><br>Joined through the Force even before they were born, he and Jaina had always been able to tell when the other was hurt or afraid. But for him to sense her over the distances that lay between them now, she must&#x2019;ve been terribly&#x2014;<br><br>The pain winked off.<br><br>&#x201c;Jaina!&#x201d; he whispered, appalled. &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>He stretched out toward her, trying to find her again. Barely aware of fuzzy shapes clustering around him and a Ryn voice hooting for a medical droid, he felt as if he were shrinking&#x2014;falling backwards into vacuum. He tried focusing deep inside and outside himself, to grab on to the Force and punch out&#x2014;or slip into a healing trance. Could he take Jaina with him, if he did? Uncle Luke had taught him a dozen focusing techniques, back at the academy, and since then.<br><br>Jacen.<br><br>A voice seemed to echo in his mind, but it wasn&#x2019;t Jaina&#x2019;s. It was deep, male&#x2014;vaguely like his uncle&#x2019;s.<br><br>Making an effort, Jacen imagined his uncle&#x2019;s face, trying to focus on that echo. An enormous white vortex seemed to spin around him. It pulled at him, drawing him toward its dazzling center.<br><br>What was going on?<br><br>Then he saw his uncle, robed in pure white, half turned away. Luke Skywalker held his shimmering lightsaber in a diagonal stance, hands at hip level, point high.<br><br>Jaina! Jacen shouted the words in his mind. Uncle Luke, Jaina&#x2019;s been hurt!<br><br>Then he saw what held his uncle&#x2019;s attention. In the dim distance, but clearly in focus, a second form straightened and darkened. Tall, humanoid, powerfully built, it had a face and chest covered with sinuous scars and tattoos. Its hips and legs were encased in rust-brown armor. Claws protruded from its heels and knuckles, and an ebony cloak flowed from its shoulders. The alien held a coal-black, snake-headed amphistaff across its body, mirroring the angle of Luke&#x2019;s lightsaber, pitting poisonous darkness against verdant light.</p><h2>The Practice of the Yoga Sutra: Sadhana Pada</h2><p><p>Pain is a harsh reality we all are familiar with. At times, many of us can feel mired down by the daily struggles and stressors of life, unsure if there is anything such as true peace.

In this exceptional new fourth edition, the authors raise questions and provide information related to the many ethical dilemmas art therapists face. Several chapters refer to the Ethical Principles for Art Therapists and Code of Professional Practice of the Art Therapy Credentials Board. Changes that were made to the AATA Ethics Document in 2013 are discussed. Models of how to think through and resolve the difficult ethical problems art therapists encounter during their professional lives are presented. A chapter discussing burnout and compassion fatigue - costs of caring -- provides an understanding of the responsibility that systems hold in supporting therapists and clients. Within each chapter, there are dilemma-laden vignettes intended to stimulate reflection and discussion. Most chapters include a series of questions pertaining to practical applications aimed at helping to review the material, formulate, and clarify positions on key issues. Also included are suggested artistic tasks intended to help the reader engage with topics in meta-cognitive, kinetic, visual, and sensory methods. Compelling illustrations throughout the text are provided as examples of creative responses to the artistic tasks. In addition, informational topics dealing with ethical violations, rights of artworks, marketing, advertising, and publicity are explored. The importance of multicultural approaches is expanded with the discussion that competence is a baseline for practice as an art therapist. Significant updates were made to the chapter that explores art therapy in the digital age. The appendices contain ethics documents of the British Association of Art Therapists for comparison. This unique book is designed for art therapy students, art therapists, expressive arts therapy professionals, and will be a useful and supplemental textbook for art therapy courses dealing with professional ethics and supervision, art therapy theory and practice.</p><p></p><h2>Practicing Presence: Simple Self-Care Strategies for Teachers</h2><p>Most teachers enter the field of education to make a difference in children&#x2019;s lives. But many end up, as author Lisa Lucas puts it, &#x201c;tired, wired, and running in circles.&#x201d; This leads to many new teachers abandoning the profession or to burnout among veteran teachers.<br> Drawing upon her own experiences, Lisa has written a book to help you more successfully manage the frustration of feeling overwhelmed. Written in an informal, conversational tone, <i>Practicing Presence</i> is filled with ideas, exercises, checklists, personal anecdotes, and practices you can use to reframe and establish a mindset that will enhance your focus and engagement in the classroom.<br> When teachers care for themselves deeply and deliberately, they are better able to care for the people that matter most in their lives&#x2014;their students, friends, and families.&nbsp; <i>Practicing Presence</i> focuses not on<i> doing</i>, but rather on<i> being</i> present in the life of the classroom. Each chapter includes self-care strategies to explore how to self-regulate, nurture self-acceptance, and promote compassion. This book will give readers the feeling of having a personal coach who provides suggestions and routines so that they not only can deal with being overwhelmed, but rise above it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Lisa Lucas has decades of experience in education, as a teacher, instructional coach, administrator, consultant, and currently an Associate Professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Agnes Mary White Sanford (1897-1982) is considered to be one of the principal founders of the Inner Healing Movement. She was the daughter of a Presbyterian missionary in China and the wife of the Episcopal priest Edgar L. Sanford. Her first book, &#34;The Healing Light,&#34; is often considered a classic in its field. Since its original 1947 publication, &#34;The Healing Light&#34; has sold over half a million copies. In this book Sanford outlines her experiences with the healing power of God. She compares the power of God to the power of electricity -- &#34;the whole universe is full of it, but only the amount of it that flows through...will work.&#34; In her down-to-earth, gentle style, Ms. Agnes Sanford explains how the love of God can become manifest in the most diverse manner. She was a key figure in the Charismatic Movement in the United States during the 1960s through to about 1980, mainly through her writing. Her books include an autobiography titled &#34;Sealed Orders.&#34;</p><p>The classic book on healing in America by one of our most renowned spiritual writers.

Nicholas Shaxson, a former correspondent for the <i>Financial Times </i>and <i>The Economist</i>, argues that tax havens are a central cause of all these disasters.</p><p>In this hard hitting investigation he uncovers how offshore tax evasion, which has cost the U.S. 100 billion dollars in lost revenue each year, is just one item on a long rap sheet outlining the damage that offshoring wreaks on our societies. In a riveting journey from Moscow to London to Switzerland to Delaware, Shaxson dives deep into a vast and secret playground where bankers and multinational corporations operate side by side with nefarious tax evaders, organized criminals and the world's wealthiest citizens. Tax havens are where all these players get to maximize their own rewards and leave the middle class to pick up the bill.</p><p>With eye opening revelations, <i>Treasure</i><i> Islands</i> exposes the culprits and its victims, and shows how:</p><p>*Over half of world trade is routed through tax havens</p><p>*The rampant practices that precipitated the latest financial crisis can be traced back to Wall Street's offshoring practices<br>*For every dollar of aid we send to developing countries, ten dollars leave again by the backdoor<br>The offshore system sits much closer to home than the pristine tropical islands of the popular imagination. In fact, it all starts on a tiny island called Manhattan. In this fast paced narrative, <i>Treasure</i><i> Islands</i> at last explains how the system works and how it's contributing to our ever deepening economic divide.</p></p><p><p><b>Nicholas Shaxson</b> is a journalist who has written for the <i>Financial</i> <i>Times</i>, <i>The Economist Group</i>, <i>African Energy</i>, and the insider newsletter <i>Africa Confidential</i>. He is the author of the highly acclaimed <i>Poisoned Wells: The Dirty Politics of African Oil</i> and an associate fellow with the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a vigorous and well researched polemic against financial deregulation...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Cooper, Foreign Affairs</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shaxson's story of offshore banking is nothing short of Shakespearean, a drama full of secrecy, treachery and corruption in which wealthy countries, companies and individuals collude to horde wealth in a complex global network of largely unregulated tax havens. To realize this end, they install corrupt leaders, exploit indigenous populations and, ultimately, deny both developed and developing nations of vital tax dollars. There is much here that should generate outrage...An admirable job of both arguing the consequences of offshore banking and providing a succinct history of the practice.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;A blistering account of the role that tax havens play in international finance. . . brilliant.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>London Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps the most important book published in the UK so far this year.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>George Monbiot, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shaxson provides a fascinating narrative that is both analytically compelling and rich in institutional detail.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Economix blog</i></p><p>&#x201c;A useful critique.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tyler Cowen, Marginal Revolution</i></p><p>&#x201c;Treasure Islands, Nicholas Shaxson's excellent book on the global offshore tax system.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>FT Alphaville</i></p><p>&#x201c;Treasure Islands has prised the lid off an important and terrifying can of worms.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Literary Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shaxson shows us that the global financial machine is broken and that very few of us have noticed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New Statesman</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this riveting, well-written expose, Shaxson goes deep into the largely unexamined realm of offshore money. In the process, he reveals that this shadow world is no mere sideshow, but is troublingly central to modern finance, with the US and the UK as leaders. The resulting abuses are widespread, ranging from tax revenue stripping from African nations to individuals and corporations escaping enforcement and accountability. A must read for anyone who wants to understand the hidden reasons why financial services firms have become so powerful and impossible to reform.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Yves Smith, creator of Naked Capitalism and author of Econned</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Treasure Islands</i> shines the light on some very dark places.

The shocking thing is its all true.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Murphy, co-author of Tax Havens: How Globalization Really Works</i></p><p>&#x201c;At last, a readable &#x2013; indeed gripping &#x2013; book which explains the nuts and bolts of tax havens. More importantly, it lays bare the mechanism that financial capital has been using to stay in charge: capturing government policy-making around the world, shaking off such irritants as democracy and the rule of law, and making sure that suckers like you and me pay for its operators' opulent lifestyles.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Misha Glenny, author of McMafia: A Journey through the Global Criminal Underworld</i></p><p>&#x201c;Trade and investments can play a profoundly productive role on the world economy. But so much of the capital flows that we see are associated with money laundering, tax evasion, and the wholesale larsony (sic) of assets often of very poor countries. These thefts are greatly facilitated by special tax and accounting rules or designed to "attract capital" and embodying obscure and opaque mechanisms. Shaxson does an outstanding and socially valuable job in penetrating the impenetrable and finds a deeply shocking world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nicholas Stern, former Chief Economist for The World Bank</i></p><p>&#x201c;The real challenge to America's economy comes not from China &#x2013; but from the Caymans, the Bahamas, and a whole hot-money archipelago loosely under the control of the City of London.

If you're wondering how ordinary people ended up paying for a crisis caused by the reckless greed of the banking industry, this compellingly readable book provides the answers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Wearing, School of Public Policy, UCL, London's Global University</i></p><p>&#x201c;An absolute gem that deserves to be read by anyone interested in the way contemporary globalization is undermining social justice. Give it to your sons, daughters, families, favorite legislators and anyone else needing stimulation of their thought buds. This masterpiece illuminates the dark places and shows the visible hand of governments, corporations, banks, accountants, lawyers and other pirates in creating fictitious offshore transactions and structures and picking our pockets. This financial engineering has enabled companies and the wealthy elites to dodge taxes. The result is poverty, erosion of social infrastructure and hard won welfare rights and higher taxes for ordinary people. Tax will be the decisive battleground of the twenty-first century as no democracy can function without it, or provide people with adequate educations, healthcare, security, housing, transport or pensions.

The result is riveting, compelling, incontestable. Impossible to put down. This book provides all anyone needs to know about the reality of prostitution in moving, insightful prose that engages and disposes of every argument ever raised in its favor.&#x201d; &#x2015;Catharine A. MacKinnon, law professor, University of Michigan and Harvard University</p><p>Born into a troubled family, Rachel Moran left home at the age of fourteen. Being homeless, she was driven into prostitution to survive. With intelligence and empathy, she describes the exploitation she and others endured on the streets and in the brothels. Moran also speaks to the psychological damage inherent to prostitution and the inevitable estrangement from one&#x2019;s body. At twenty-two, Moran escaped the sex trade. She has since become a writer and an abolitionist activist.</p></p><p>Rachel Moran is the founder of the organization SPACE International (Survivors of Prostitution-Abuse Calling for Enlightenment). She has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in journalism and a master&#x2019;s degree in creative writing and speaks globally on prostitution and sex-trafficking. She lives in Dublin, Ireland.&#x201c;This is surely the best, most personal, profound, eye-opening book ever written about prostitution&#x2015;irrefutable proof of why it should NEVER be legalized.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jane Fonda</strong><br><br>&#x201c;People who are working to end sexual exploitation will take heart from her example of transformation and an insistence on basic human dignity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>President Jimmy Carter</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rachel Moran takes us where no readers have ever gone: into the deep hell of being prostituted... Anyone who believes "sex work" is chosen or a job like any other should read <em>Paid For</em> for its exposure of misinformation and myths alone. But the book is more: Moran writes so well that her story will scorch your heart....&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robin Morgan</strong><br><br>&#x201c;No amount of theory from those who have never been prostituted can replace the truth and power of experience. Rachel Moran's <em>Paid For</em> should be required reading in courses on human rights, in police training and law schools, and in sex education courses that separate welcome sex from body invasion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Paid For</em> fuses the memoirist's lived poignancy with the philosopher's conceptual sophistication.

MacKinnon, law professor, University of Michigan and Harvard University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;As a survivor, I can say <em>Paid For</em> got to the heart of what sex-trafficked and prostituted women face on a daily basis. Rachel speaks for those survivors who can&#x2019;t speak for themselves, and for those who have been lost to the life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Vednita Carter, Founder and Executive Director, Breaking Free</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Paid For</em> is the political sword we desperately need to slay once and for all the myths and fairytales surrounding the sex trade.

Commenting on this startling discovery at the time, noted Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin argued that some Christians will find it shocking a challenge to the uniqueness of their theology.&#x201d;<br> <br>In this powerful, groundbreaking work, Boyarin guides us through a rich tapestry of new discoveries and ancient scriptures to make the powerful case that our conventional understandings of Jesus and of the origins of Christianity are wrong. Boyarin&#x2019;s scrupulously illustrated account argues that the coming of the Messiah was fully imagined in the ancient Jewish texts. Jesus, moreover, was embraced by many Jews as this person, and his core teachings were not at all a break from Jewish beliefs and teachings. Jesus and his followers, Boyarin shows, were simply Jewish. What came to be known as Christianity came much later, as religious and political leaders sought to impose a new religious orthodoxy that was not present at the time of Jesus&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>Published in hardcover to nationwide attention and now available for the first time in paperback, this brilliant work will continue to challenge some of our most cherished assumptions.<br></p><p><b>Daniel Boyarin</b>, Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture and rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships.

How he tries to persuade the family he lives with to make him another blueberry pie occupies a great deal of hard housework task performance, but the humans fail to notice Elmer's efforts until they see his red cherry pie stained footprints on their table. Finally Elmer has found a way to communicate his wish for blueberry pie to his people! Fortunately they take the hint and reward his hard housework duties with a large, luscious blueberry pie. Elmer remembers to leave his sincere thanks in blueberry pie juice letters. The red, white, blue and black ink of the illustrations add to the piquance of "The Blueberry Pie Elf," making this appealing book a winner for children age 4 and up. --Midwest Book Review, July, 20, 2010</p></p><h2>What the Wind Knows</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i> bestseller.</b></p><p><b>In an unforgettable love story, a woman&#x2019;s impossible journey through the ages could change everything...</b></p><p>Anne Gallagher grew up enchanted by her grandfather&#x2019;s stories of Ireland.

She fostered the culture of the Enlightenment and greatly expanded the immense empire created by Czar Ivan the Terrible, shifting the balance of power in Europe eastward. Famous for her will to power and for her dozen lovers, Catherine was also a prolific and gifted writer. <br><br>Fluent in French, Russian, and German, Catherine published political theory, journalism, comedies, operas, and history, while writing thousands of letters as she corresponded with Voltaire and other public figures. The Memoirs of Catherine the Great provides an unparalleled window into eighteenth-century Russia and the mind of an absolute ruler. <br><br>With insight, humor, and candor, Catherine presents her eyewitness account of history, from her whirlwind entry into the Russian court in 1744 at age fourteen as the intended bride of Empress Elizabeth I&#x2019;s nephew, the eccentric drunkard and future Peter III, to her unhappy marriage; from her two children, several miscarriages, and her and Peter&#x2019;s numerous affairs to the political maneuvering that enabled Catherine to seize the throne from him in 1762. Catherine&#x2019;s eye for telling details makes for compelling reading as she describes the dramatic fall and rise of her political fortunes.<br><br>This definitive new translation from the French is scrupulously faithful to her words and is the first for which translators have consulted original manuscripts written in Catherine&#x2019;s own hand. It is an indispensable work for anyone interested in Catherine the Great, Russian history, or the eighteenth century.</p><p>About the Translators<br><br>Mark Cruse has a Ph.D. in French literature from New York University and teaches at Arizona State University.<br><br>Hilde Hoogenboom received her Ph.D. in Russian literature from Columbia University and teaches Russian and translation at the State University of New York at Albany.1728&#x2014;43<br><br>Peter III&#x2019;s childhood and education in Holstein; heir to the Russian throne<br><br>The mother of Peter III, daughter of Peter I, died of consumption about two months after bringing him into the world in the little town of Kiel in Holstein, from the despair of being consigned to live there and from being so unhappily married. Karl Friedrich, Duke of Holstein, nephew of Charles XII, King of Sweden, and father of Peter III, was a weak, ugly, short, sickly and poor prince (see Bergholz&#x2019;s journal in B�sching&#x2019;s Magazin). He died in the year 1739 and left his son, who was around eleven years old, under the guardianship of his cousin Adolph Friedrich, the Bishop of L�beck and Duke of Holstein, since chosen King of Sweden as a result of the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo on the recommendation of Empress Elizabeth.<br><br>Peter III&#x2019;s education was directed by Br�mmer, the Grand Marshal of the Court and a Swede by birth, and under him were Grand Chamberlain Bergholz, author of the aforementioned journal, and four chamberlains, two of whom&#x2014;Adlerfelt, the author of a history of Charles XII, and Wachmeister&#x2014;were Swedish, and the other two, Wolff and Mardefeld, were from Holstein. They raised the Prince for the throne of Sweden in a court that was too large for the country in which it was located and that was divided into several factions, which hated each other and vied to control the Prince&#x2019;s mind, which each faction wanted to shape. As a result, these factions inspired in him the reciprocal hatred they felt against the individuals they opposed. The young prince politely detested Br�mmer and his overbearing way and accused the Grand Marshal of excessive severity; he despised Bergholz, who was Br�mmer&#x2019;s friend and toady, and liked none of his attendants, because they hampered him.<br><br> From the age of ten, Peter III was partial to drink. He had to make many public appearances and was never out of sight day or night. Those he liked best during his childhood and the first years of his stay in Russia were his two old valets: Kramer, a Livonian, and Romberg, a Swede. The latter was his favorite; he was a rather vulgar and rough man who had been a dragoon officer under Charles XII. Br�mmer and as a result Bergholz, who trusted blindly in Br�mmer, were attached to Adolph Friedrich, Prince Bishop of L�beck and Prince Guardian and Administrator; all the others were unhappy with this Prince and even more with his entourage.<br><br>Once Empress Elizabeth had ascended to the throne of Russia, she sent Chamberlain Korf to Holstein to summon her nephew, whom the Prince Administrator sent off immediately, accompanied by Grand Marshal Br�mmer, Grand Chamberlain Bergholz, and Chamberlain Ducker, Br�mmer&#x2019;s nephew. The Empress&#x2019;s joy was great when he arrived. She left shortly thereafter for her coronation in Moscow.� She was resolved to declare the Prince her heir. But first he had to profess the Greek Orthodox faith. The enemies of Grand Marshal Br�mmer, notably Grand Chancellor Count Bestuzhev and the late Count N. Panin, who had long been Russian minister in Sweden, claimed to have in hand convincing proof that as soon as Br�mmer saw the Empress determined to declare her nephew heir apparent to the throne, he took as much care to spoil the mind and heart of his pupil as he had taken to make him worthy of the Swedish crown.<br><br>But I have always doubted this atrocious allegation and have believed that the education of Peter III was undermined by a clash of unfortunate circumstances. I will relate what I have seen and heard, and that in itself will clarify many things. I saw Peter III for the first time when he was eleven years old, in Eutin at the home of his guardian, the Prince Bishop of L�beck. Some months after the death of Duke Karl Friedrich, Peter III&#x2019;s father, the Prince Bishop had in 1739 assembled all of his family at his home in Eutin to have his ward brought there. My grandmother, mother of the Prince Bishop, and my mother, sister of this same Prince, had come there from Hamburg with me. I was ten years old at the time. Prince August and Princess Anna, brother and sister of the Prince Guardian and Administrator of Holstein, were also there.<br><br>It was then that I heard it said among this assembled family that the young duke was inclined to drink, that his attendants found it difficult to prevent him from getting drunk at meals, that he was restive and hotheaded, did not like his attendants and especially Br�mmer, and that otherwise he showed vivacity, but had a delicate and sickly appearance. In truth, his face was pale in color and he seemed to be thin and of a delicate constitution. His attendants wanted to give this child the appearance of a mature man, and to this end they hampered and restrained him, which could only inculcate falseness in his conduct as well as his character.<br><br>Soon after this Holstein court arrived in Russia, it was followed by a Swedish embassy that requested the Empress allow her nephew to succeed to the Swedish throne. But Elizabeth, who had already declared her intentions in the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo, mentioned above, replied to the Swedish Diet that she had already declared her nephew heir to the throne of Russia and that she adhered to the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo, which made the Prince Administrator of Holstein heir apparent to the Swedish crown. (This Prince had had an older brother to whom Empress Elizabeth had been engaged after the death of Peter I. The marriage had not taken place, because the prince died of smallpox several weeks after the engagement. Empress Elizabeth retained tender feelings for his memory, and she gave tokens of her affection to the prince&#x2019;s entire family.)<br><br>Peter III was thus declared Elizabeth&#x2019;s heir and Grand Duke of Russia after he professed his faith according to the Greek Orthodox rite; Simeon Theodorsky, since named Archbishop of Pskov, was made his spiritual instructor. The Prince had been baptized and raised in the Lutheran faith, the most rigid and least tolerant, and since his childhood he had always been resistant to all instruction. I heard it said by his attendants that at Kiel it had required great effort to make him go to church on Sundays and feast days, and to make him perform devotional acts, which were forced upon him, and that most of the time he acted irreligiously.<br><br>His Imperial Highness took it into his head to dispute every point with Simeon Theodorsky. Often his attendants were called in to cut short these bitter exchanges and to calm the Prince&#x2019;s heated emotions. Finally, after much frustration, the Prince submitted to the wishes of the Empress, his aunt, although, whether from prejudice, habit, or a contradictory spirit, he often made it known that he would have preferred to leave for Sweden rather than stay in Russia.<br><br>He kept Br�mmer, Bergholz, and his Holstein entourage around him until his marriage. Some other tutors were added to these as a formality: one was Monsieur Isaak Veselovsky for the Russian language, who came at first rarely and eventually not at all; the other, Professor St�hlin, was supposed to teach him math and history, but in truth played with him and practically served as his buffoon. The most conscientious teacher was the ballet master Land�, who taught him to dance.<br><br>During this period, the Grand Duke spent all his time making two servants, who had been assigned for his personal service, perform military exercises in his private chambers. He gave them titles and ranks and demoted them according to his whim. These were truly the games of a child and of perpetual childishness. In general he was still very much a child, although he turned sixteen in 1744 when the Russian court was in Moscow.<br><br>1744<br><br>Catherine&#x2019;s arrival in Russia; Bestuzhev-Riumin and court factions; her illness; her mother&#x2019;s politics at court; her profession of the Orthodox faith and betrothal to Peter; trip to Kiev; Catherine&#x2019;s debts; Peter has measles, then smallpox<br><br>That year, Catherine II arrived with her mother in Moscow on February 9. At that time, the Russian court was divided into two large factions or parties. The leader of the first group, who had begun to recover from his weakened position, was Vice Chancellor Bestuzhev-Riumin. He was infinitely more feared than loved, exceedingly scheming, suspicious, willful, and daring, rather tyrannical in his principles, an implacable enemy, but a friend to his friends, whom he abandoned only when they turned their backs on him, and otherwise hard to get along with and often overly exacting. He was in charge of the department of foreign affairs. Having battled with the Empress&#x2019;s entourage, he had lost ground before the journey to Moscow, but had begun to recover. He supported the courts of Vienna, Saxony, and England. The arrival of Catherine II and her mother gave him no pleasure. It was the secret work of the faction opposed to him. The enemies of Count Bestuzhev were numerous, but he made them all tremble. He had the advantage over them in his position and his character, which gave him immense influence in the politics of the antechamber.<br><br>The party opposed to Bestuzhev supported France, its ally Sweden, and the King of Prussia. The Marquis de la Ch�tardie was its soul and the Holstein court its ringleaders; they had won over Lestocq, one of the principal actors of the revolution that had placed the late Empress Elizabeth on the throne of Russia. Lestocq was greatly trusted by Elizabeth. He had been her personal surgeon since the death of Empress Catherine I, to whom he had also been devoted, and had rendered essential services to both mother and daughter. He lacked neither intelligence, shrewdness, nor capacity for intrigue, but he was malicious and had a black and evil heart. All these foreigners aided one another and promoted Count Mikhail Vorontsov, who had also taken part in the coup d&#x2019;�tat and had accompanied Elizabeth the night she took the throne. She had made him marry the niece of Empress Catherine I, Countess Anna Karlovna Skavronskaya, who had been brought up in Empress Elizabeth&#x2019;s household and was very devoted to the Empress. This faction also included Count Alexander Rumiantsev, father of the Marshal who had signed the Treaty of �bo with Sweden, about which Bestuzhev had been little consulted. The faction also counted upon the Procurator General Prince Trubetskoi, upon the whole Trubetskoi family and, consequently, upon the Prince of Hessen-Hamburg, who had married a princess of this family. The Prince of<br><br>Hessen-Hamburg, who at the time was highly regarded, was nothing by himself, and his influence came from the large family of his wife, whose father and mother were still alive; the latter was highly respected. The rest of the Empress&#x2019;s entourage then consisted of the Shuvalov family, who opposed in all matters the Grand Master of the Hunt Razumovsky and a bishop, who for the moment was the leading favorite. Count Bestuzhev knew how to exploit the Shuvalovs, but his principal supporter was Baron Cherkasov, Secretary of the Cabinet to the Empress, who had already served in Peter I&#x2019;s cabinet. He was a rough and headstrong man who wanted order and justice, and to run everything by the rules. The rest of the court chose one faction or the other according to their interests or daily opinions.<br><br>The Grand Duke appeared to rejoice at the arrival of my mother and myself. I was in my fifteenth year. During the first ten days he paid me much attention. Even then and in that short time, I saw and understood that he did not care much for the nation that he was destined to rule, and that he clung to Lutheranism, did not like his entourage, and was very childish. I remained silent and listened, and this gained me his trust. I remember him telling me that among other things, what pleased him most about me was that I was his second cousin, and that because I was related to him, he could speak to me with an open heart. Then he told me that he was in love with one of the Empress&#x2019;s maids of honor, who had been dismissed from court because of the misfortune of her mother, one Madame Lopukhina, who had been exiled to Siberia, that he would have liked to marry her, but that he was resigned to marry me because his aunt desired it. I listened with a blush to these family confidences, thanking him for his ready trust, but deep in my heart I was astonished by his imprudence and lack of judgment in many matters.<br><br>The tenth day after my arrival in Moscow, a Saturday, the Empress went to the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergei. The Grand Duke stayed with us in Moscow. I had already been assigned three tutors: Simeon Theodorsky to instruct me in the Greek Orthodox faith, Basil Adadurov for the Russian language, and Land�, the ballet master, for dancing. To make more rapid progress in Russian, I rose from my bed at night and, while everyone slept, memorized the lessons that Adadurov gave me. Because my room was warm and I had no experience of the climate, I neglected to put on my shoes and studied in my bedclothes. On the thirteenth day after my arrival, I came down with pleurisy, which was nearly fatal. It began with chills the Tuesday after the Empress&#x2019;s departure for Trinity Monastery. I had just gotten dressed to go to dinner with my mother at the Grand Duke&#x2019;s, when I obtained with difficulty her permission to go to bed. When she returned from dinner, she found me almost unconscious with a high fever and an excruciating pain in my side. She thought I was coming down with smallpox, sent for doctors, and wanted them to treat me accordingly. They recommended that I be bled; she was completely against this, saying that it was from being bled that her brother had died of smallpox in Russia and that she did not want<br><br>the same thing to happen to me. The doctors and the attendants of the Grand Duke, who had not had smallpox, made a detailed report of the state of affairs to the Empress, and while my mother and the doctors were arguing, I lay unconscious in my bed, with a burning fever and a pain in my side that made me suffer horribly and moan, for which my mother scolded me, wanting me to endure my suffering patiently.</p><h2>The Jesus Fast: The Call to Awaken the Nations</h2><p><b>A Passionate, Prophetic Summons to Prayer and Fasting<br></b><br>We are poised at a key moment in history.

The black-clad Special Forces soldiers slipped unseen through the pitch-dark night toward the target house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In most town and city centers there is always a glimmer of light, even in deepest night, but this was the outer suburb of an English provincial town and all public lighting had ceased at one in the morning. This was the darkest hour, two a.m. A solitary fox watched them pass but instinct bade him not interfere with fellow hunters. No house lights broke the gloom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They encountered two single humans, both on foot, both drunk after late-night partying with friends. The soldiers melted into gardens and shrubbery, disappearing black on black until the wanderers had stumbled toward their homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They knew exactly where they were, having studied the streets and the target house in intimate detail for many hours. The pictures had been taken by cruising cars and overhead drones. Much enlarged and pinned to the wall of the briefing room at Stirling Lines, the headquarters of the SAS outside Hereford, the images had been memorized to the last stone and curb. The soft-booted men did not trip or stumble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were a dozen of them, and they included two Americans, inserted at the insistence of the U.S. team that had installed itself in the embassy in London. And there were two from the British SRR, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, a unit even more clandestine than the SAS and the SBS, the Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, respectively. The authorities had elected to use the SAS, known simply as "the Regiment."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the two from the SRR was a woman. The Americans presumed this was to establish gender equality. It was the reverse. Observation had revealed that one of the inhabitants of the target house was female and even the British hard squads try to observe a little gallantry. The point of the presence of the SRR, sometimes referred to in the club as "Her Majesty's burglars," was to practice one of their many skill sets-covert entry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mission was not only to enter and subdue the target house and its denizens but to ensure they were not seen by any watcher inside and that no one escaped. They approached from all angles, appeared simultaneously around the garden fence, front, back and sides, crossed the garden and ringed the house, still unseen and unheard, by neighbor or inhabitant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one heard the slight squeak of the diamond-tipped glass cutter as it described a neat circle in a kitchen window, nor the low crack as the disk was removed with a suction pad. A gloved hand came through the hole and unlatched the window. A black figure climbed over the sill into the sink, jumped quietly to the floor and opened the back door. The team slipped in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though they had all studied the architect's plan, filed with the registry when the house was built, they still used head-mounted penlights in case of owner-installed obstructions or even booby traps. They began with the ground floor, moving from room to room to confirm there were no sentries or sleeping figures, trip wires or silent alarms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After ten minutes the team leader was satisfied and with a nod of his head led a single-file column of five up the narrow staircase of what was evidently a very ordinary detached four-bedroom family home. The two Americans, increasingly bewildered, remained below. This was not the way they would have subdued a thoroughly dangerous nest of terrorists. Such a house invasion back home would have involved several magazines of ammunition by now. Clearly, the Limeys were pretty weird.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those below heard startled exclamations from above. These quickly ceased. After ten more minutes of muttered instructions the team leader uttered his first report. He did not use Internet or cell phone-interceptible-but old-fashioned encrypted radio. "Target subdued," he said softly. "Inhabitants four. Await sunrise." Those who listened to him knew what would happen next. It had all been preplanned and rehearsed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two Americans, both U.S. Navy SEALs, also reported in to their embassy on the south side of the Thames in London.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for the "hard" takeover of the building was simple. Despite a week of covert surveillance, it was still possible, bearing in mind the amount of damage to the defenses of the entire Western world that had come out of that harmless-looking suburban house, that it might contain armed men. There might be terrorists, fanatics, mercenaries hiding behind the innocent fa ade. That was why the Regiment had been told there was no alternative to a "worst case" operation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But an hour later the team leader communicated again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You are not going to believe what we have found here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the very early morning of 3 April 2019, a telephone rang in a modest bedroom under the eaves of the Special Forces Club in an anonymous townhouse in Knightsbridge, a wealthy district of London�s West End. At the third ring the bedside light came on. The sleeper was awake and fully functioning-the outcome of a lifetime of practice. He swung his feet to the floor and glanced at the illuminated panel before putting the apparatus to his ear. He also glanced at the clock beside the lamp. Four in the morning. Did this woman never sleep?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, Prime Minister."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The person at the other end clearly had not been to bed at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Adrian, sorry to wake you at this hour. Could you be with me at nine? I have to greet the Americans. I suspect they will be on the warpath and I would appreciate your assessment and advice. They are due at ten."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always the old-fashioned courtesy. She was giving an order, not making a request. For friendship she would use his given name. He would always call her by her title.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course, Prime Minister."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing more to say, so the connection ended. Sir Adrian Weston rose and went into the small but sufficient bathroom to shower and shave. At half past four he went downstairs, past the black-framed portraits of all the agents who had gone into Nazi-occupied Europe so long ago and never come back, nodded to the night watch behind the lobby desk and let himself out. He knew a hotel on Sloane Street with an all-night caf .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly before 9 a.m. on a bright autumn morning, 11 September 2001, a four-jet American airliner out of Boston for Los Angeles designated American Airlines 11 swerved out of the sky over Manhattan and slammed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. It had been hijacked in midair by five terrorists in the service of the group al-Qaeda. The man at the controls was an Egyptian. He was supported by four Saudis who, armed with box-cutter knives, had subdued the cabin staff and hustled him onto the flight deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Minutes later, another airliner, flying far too low, appeared over New York. It was United Airlines 175, also out of Boston for Los Angeles, also hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>America and, within moments, the entire world watched in disbelief as what had been presumed a tragic accident revealed it was nothing of the sort. The second Boeing 767 flew deliberately into the South Tower of the Trade Center. Both skyscrapers sustained terminal damage in the midsections. Aided by the fuel from the full tanks of the airliners, savage fires erupted and began to melt the steel girders that held the buildings rigid. A minute before ten a.m., the South Tower collapsed into a mountain of red-hot rubble, followed by the North Tower half an hour later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77 out of Washington's Dulles International Airport, also bound for Los Angeles with full tanks, dived into the Pentagon, on the Virginia side of the Potomac. It had also been hijacked by five Arabs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fourth airliner, United Airlines 93, out of Newark for San Francisco, again hijacked in midair, was recaptured by a passenger revolt, but too late to save the aircraft, which, with its fanatical hijacker still at the controls, dived into farmland in Pennsylvania.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before sundown that day, now known simply as 9/11, a fraction under three thousand Americans and others were dead. They included the crews and passengers of all four airliners, almost all those in the World Trade Center's two skyscraper towers and 125 in the Pentagon. Plus the nineteen terrorists who committed suicide. That single day left the United States not simply shocked but traumatized. She still is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When an American government is wounded that badly, it does two things. It demands and exacts revenge, and it spends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the eight years of the George W. Bush presidency and the first four years of that of Barack Obama, the United States spent a trillion dollars constructing the biggest, the most cumbersome, the most duplicated and possibly the most inefficient national security structure the world has ever seen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the nine inner U.S. intelligence agencies and the seven outer agencies had been doing their jobs in 2001, 9/11 would never have occurred. There were signs, hints, reports, tip-offs, indications and oddities that were noted, reported, filed and ignored.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What followed 9/11 was an explosion of expenditure that is literally breathtaking. Something had to be done, and be seen to be done, by the great American public, so it was. A raft of new agencies was created to duplicate and mirror the work of the existing ones. Thousands of new skyscrapers sprang up, entire cities of them, most owned and run by private sector-contracted enterprises eager for the fathomless dollar harvest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Government expenditure on the single pandemic word "security" detonated like a nuke over Bikini Atoll, all uncomplainingly paid for by the ever-trusting, ever-hopeful, ever-gullible American taxpayer. The exercise generated an explosion of reports, on paper and online, so vast that only about 10 percent of them have ever been read. There simply is not the time or, despite the massive payroll, the staff to begin to cope with the information. And something else happened in those twelve years. The computer and its archive, the database, became rulers of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the Englishman seeking an early breakfast off Sloane Street was a young officer in the Paras, then in MI6, records were created on paper and stored on paper. It took time, and the storage of archives took space, but penetration, the copying or removal and theft of secret archives-that is, espionage-was hard and the quantity removable at any one time or from any one place was modest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the Cold War, which supposedly ended with the Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, the great spies like Oleg Penkovsky could abstract only as many documents as they could carry about their person. Then the Minox camera and its product, microfilm, enabled up to a hundred documents to be concealed in a small canister. The microdot made copied documents even smaller and more transportable. But the computer revolutionized the lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When defector and traitor Edward Snowden flew from Hawaii to Moscow it is believed he carried over one and a half million documents on a memory stick small enough to be inserted during a border check into the human anus. "Back in the day," as the veterans put it, a column of trucks would have been needed, and a convoy moving through the gate tends to be noticeable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So as the computer took over from the human, the archives containing trillions of secrets came to be stored on databases. As the complexities of this mysterious dimension called "cyberspace" became more and more weird and increasingly complicated, fewer and fewer human brains could understand how they worked. Matching pace, crime also changed, gravitating from shoplifting through financial embezzlement to today's daily computer fraud, which enables more wealth to be stolen than ever before in the history of finance. Thus the modern world has given rise to the concept of computerized hidden wealth but also to the computer hacker. The burglar of cyberspace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But some hackers do not steal money; they steal secrets. Which is why a harmless-looking suburban house in a provincial English town was invaded in the night by an Anglo-American team of Special Forces soldiers and its inhabitants detained. And why one of those soldiers murmured into a radio mic: "You are not going to believe what we have found here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three months before the raid, a team of American computer aces working at the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, Maryland, discovered what they also could not believe. The most secret database in the United States, probably in the world, had apparently been hacked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fort Meade, as the word "fort" implies, is technically an army base. But it is a lot more than that. It is the home of the fearsome National Security Agency, or NSA. Heavily shielded from unwanted view by forests and forbidden access roads, it is the size of a city. But instead of a mayor it has a four-star army general as its commanding officer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the home of that branch of all intelligence agencies known as ELINT, or electronic intelligence. Inside its perimeter, rank upon rank of computers eavesdrop on the world. ELINT intercepts, it listens, it records, it stores. If something it intercepts is dangerous, it warns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because not everyone speaks English, it translates from every language, dialect and patois used on planet Earth. It encrypts and decodes. It hoards the secrets of the United States and it does this inside a range of supercomputers which house the most clandestine databases in the country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These databases are protected not by a few traps or pitfalls but by firewalls so complicated that those who constructed them and who monitor them on a daily basis were utterly convinced they were impenetrable. Then one day these guardians of the American cybersoul stared in disbelief at the evidence before them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They checked and checked again. It could not be. It was not possible. Finally, three of them were forced to seek an interview with the general and destroy his day. Their principal database had been hacked. In theory, the access codes were so opaque that no one without them could enter the heartland of the supercomputer. No one could get through the protective device known simply as the "air gap." But someone had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Worldwide, there are thousands of hacker attacks per day. The vast bulk are attempts to steal money. There are endeavors to penetrate the bank accounts of citizens who have deposited their savings where they believed they would be safe. If the hacks are successful, the swindler can pretend to be the account holder and instruct the bank's computer to transfer assets to the thief's account, many miles and often many cou...</p></p><h2>Study Guide for Wong&#39;s Nursing Care of Infants and Children</h2><p><p>Corresponding chapter by chapter to the completely reorganized and revised <b>Wong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children, 11th Edition</b>, this study guide helps you apply pediatric nursing concepts to real-world practice.

These nutritious nuts can be used as a fabulous gluten-free flour in breads and baked goods of all types, a fantastic base for sweet dishes or non-dairy milks, a grain-free hot cereal, a delicious coffee substitute or a protein in main dishes -- in addition to hundreds of other delicious uses. You can&#39;t get much more paleo than acorns. People were eating acorns long before they began cultivating grains. They make a delicious grain-free flour but are also great for vegans and vegetarians, since acorns provide a complete protein and make truly delectable &#34;meatballs&#34; and other savory dishes. You can even soak and blend dried acorns and make a rich, nutty non-dairy milk or cream from them. Roasted acorns create robust flavored dishes, while dried acorn flour has a more buttery, almost caramel-like flavor. When dried acorns are ground into a coarse meal, they cook up similar to corn meal. When ground fine, they work as a great gluten-free flour. When they&#39;re not roasted or dried, the chopped or whole acorns are similar in texture to garbanzo beans with a nutty flavor. Roasted nuts can be stored whole and then ground as flour when needed, or soaked and used the way you would dried beans. So why doesn&#39;t everybody still eat acorns? Like so much else, the knowledge has been lost to many over time. Acorns contain bitter tannins that must be leached out before you can cook with them. The good news is that it&#39;s easy to do and there are several great ways to do this that produce acorns and acorn flour with different flavors and uses (all covered in the book with details and pictures). In this comprehensive book, you&#39;ll learn the history and nutritional benefits of acorns, plus how to: Find acorns Easily sort out the good from the bad Process your acorns in a variety of ways Make acorn flour and meal Store acorns and acorn flour so they stay fresh Cook over 70 delicious sweet and savory recipes for acorn pancakes, donuts, drinks, soup, meatballs, fritters, stuffing, ice cream, cookies and much more.

I have the greatest love and respect for her unusual gifts and talents. Joan&#x2019;s voracious quest for healing has led her to the very best practices of 2,000 years of human energy healing, which has only gone mainstream in the last 30 years. Because of her special bond and gifts with our four-legged, winged, and even finned animal friends, Joan has taken 2,000 years of healing wisdom and adapted it for our most beloved animal companions. I once heard healing with energy medicine described as simply &#x2018;giving love.&#x2019; Animals, with their capacity for unconditional love, often respond far better than humans to energy treatments. Joan&#x2019;s new book, Energy Healing for Animals, is crystal clear in its writing and teaching. It allows any two-legged human to easily learn these time-tested energy medicine techniques and &#x2018;share love&#x2019; with all your beloveds.

As an energy practitioner and long-time companion animal owner, I&#x2019;ve needed a book like this for decades. Like us, animals are composed of a series of energy systems. How can I use love, intention, and &#x2018;emotional leadership,&#x2019; one of Joan&#x2019;s key phrases, to balance and support the animals in my world? How about energy techniques, nutrition, and telepathy?

Her goal of harvesting the correct energy paths to maximize health and happiness is inspirational and makes it easy to refocus when any patient/pet is in need. I know those who read this will find themselves equally engrossed in the pages.&#x201d; &#x2015;Cindy Rigg, DVM, CCRT, cindyriggdvm.com</p><p>&#x201c;The thing about energy healing is that you do it all the time whether you realize it or not.

But the vocation to ministry must be understood as a call to identity as well as to practice, one that is rooted in Jesus' life and ministry as well as the Spirit's charisms. In<i>Introducing the Practice of Ministry</i> Kathleen A.Cahalan defines ministerial leadership as carried out through the practices of teaching, preaching, pastoral care, worship, social ministry, and administration for the sake of nurturing the life of discipleship in the community of believers. In her examination of charisms for each of the practices of ministry, Cahalan presents readers with a Trinitarian foundation, noting that the practices of discipleship and ministry have their origin in the very practices of God."</p> <p><i>Kathleen A. Cahalan is associate professor of theology at Saint John's University School of Theology, Seminary in Collegeville, Minnesota. She is author of </i>Formed in the Image of Christ: The Sacramental-Moral Theology of Bernard H�ring <i>(Liturgical Press, 2004) and </i>Projects That Matter: Successful Planning and Evaluation for Religious Organizations <i>(Alban Institute, 2003).

Cahalan is associate professor of theology at Saint John's University School of Theology/Seminary in Collegeville, Minnesota. She is author of <i>Formed in the Image of Christ: The Sacramental-Moral Theology of Bernard H&#x201e;ring</i> (Liturgical Press, 2004) and <i>Projects That Matter: Successful Planning and Evaluation for Religious Organizations</i> (Alban Institute, 2003). She is the past-president of the Association of Practical Theology.Catholic practical theologian Kathleen Cahalan has written an outstanding book on ministry. It is a rare thing to find a book on ministry that is both theologically rich and broadly accessible. More rare still is a book that could be of value to one in the throes of discerning a call to ministry as well as to the wise pastor many years into ministry. . . . The Trinitarian, missional, and vocational frame of her argument make this a very welcome book for Lutherans and other mainline Protestants, and her deep focus on the Spirit&#x2019;s gifts suggests a fruitful opening to a broad array of other Protestant churches.Word &amp; World<br><br>Cahalan&#x2019;s book is an eloquently written resource for reflecting on the nature and purpose of ministry. Those who teach seminary students, work with interns, or mentor new pastors will find this book extremely helpful. Those who are reflecting on their own call to ministry will find here a rigorous discussion and more than a place to start.Interpretation<br><br>In my research about pastoral ministry, it has become evident that books that give an account of the practice of ministry are in short supply. Cahalan&#x2019;s book is a welcome gift to fill that gap. Pastors, theological teachers and those discerning a call to ministry may all find a welcome in its pages.Christian Century<br><br>Grounded in practical theology, Kathleen Cahalan&#x2019;s Introducing the Practice of Ministry is an ideal text for students and those practicing ministry who are discerning their own ministerial roles.Worship<br><br>So many studies of ministry perpetuate the heroic myth that ministers stand apart from other Christians as specialists who labor at holy matters in self-contained way. By contrast, Kathleen Cahalan reconnects us with the wider, deeper wisdom of the church, that ministry exists in and for the community of disciples. With clear insight, consistent vision, and close attention to theological resources, she offers a compelling case that the practices of ministry are intimately related to the life of discipleship and therefore aim mainly at its thriving. With ecumenical reach, this book is a liberating alternative to stale views of ministry and a fine example of how practical theology contributes directly to the church&#x2019;s witness today.James Nieman, PhD, Professor of Practical Theology, Hartford Institute for Religion Research, Hartford Seminary, Connecticut <br><br>A welcome guide from a wise practitioner. Coming in the midst of one of the most profound ministerial transformations in the history of Christianity, Cahalan&#x2019;s introduction keeps us firmly focused on what is most important&#x2014;discipleship. With great pastoral sensitivity and keen theological insight, Cahalan situates ministry within a vision of discipleship rooted in the practices that defined Jesus&#x2019; own life. Gently, we are drawn into a process of reflection and discernment that seeks to integrate what we do, how we live, and who we are called to be. This wonderful text is essential reading for all of us learning to minister in a changing church.Edward P. Hahnenberg, Author of Ministries: A Relational Approach and Awakening Vocation: A Theology of Christian Call <br><br>Prudent without a hint of stuffiness, wise without ever being aloof, Kathleen Cahalan has conjured up one smart book on ministry. With the heart of a practical theologian and the charism of a gifted teacher, she weaves multiple threads, sources, and insights into a work both lucid and passionate. Theoretically strong without a hint of stodginess, Cahalan is a gifted guide who leads us to the heart of the matter. Surely a classic in the making, anyone involved in ministry formation needs to read this book.Edward Foley, Capuchin, Duns Scotus Professor of Spirituality, Professor of Liturgy and Music, Catholic Theological Union <br><br>There are so many wonderful things to say about this book, I don&#x2019;t know where to start. It fills a real gap in introductory literature. It is a perfect book for those trying to discern a call. It speaks about ministry as a whole rather than a bunch of component parts (e.g., pastoral care, leadership, preaching). It is richly grounded in Scripture, attentive to practice, and deeply theological. Step by step, with clarity and wisdom, drawing on years of teaching and a keen eye for the right literature from a range of disciplines, Kathleen Cahalan guides us well through the aims and architecture of ministry.Bonnie J.

Like Jimmie Rodgers, Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Townes Van Zandt was the embodiment of that mythic American figure, the troubled troubadour. <i>A Deeper Blue </i>traces Van Zandt&#x2019;s background as the scion of a prominent Texas family; his troubled early years and his transformation from promising pre-law student to wandering folk singer; his life on the road and the demons that pursued and were pursued by him; the women who loved and inspired him; and the brilliance and enduring beauty of his songs, which are explored in depth.&nbsp;The author draws on eight years&#x2019; extensive research and interviews with Townes&#x2019; family and closest friends and colleagues. He looks beyond the legend and paints a colorful portrait of a complex man who embraced the darkness of demons and myth as well as the light of deep compassion and humanity, all &#x201c;for the sake of the song.&#x201d;</p><p>&#34;The author talked to many, many people who knew Townes.

They instantly hit it off, and their boyhood escapades at Bushy Meads School built a bond that was never broken. The&nbsp;duo found themselves riding an astonishing roller coaster of success, taking them all over the world. They made and broke iconic records, they were treated like gods, but they stayed true to their friendship and ultimately to themselves. It was a party that seemed as if it would never end. And then it did, in front of tens of thousands of tearful fans at Wembley Stadium in 1986.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew&#x2019;s memoir covers in wonderful detail those years, up until that last iconic concert: the scrapes, the laughs, the relationships, the good, and the bad. It&#x2019;s a unique and one-and-only time to remember that era, that band, and those boys.</p><p><b>Andrew Ridgeley</b> is a musician and record producer best known for his part in Wham!. He lives in England.<b>Chapter 1: Decisions, Decisions</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>November 1979</i><br> &nbsp;<br> We were the best of friends, and two sides of the same coin. Georgios Panayiotou was a studious and shy, broccoli-haired sixteen-year-old with a muffin-top waistline and a wardrobe full of questionable outfits. I, on the other hand, was self-assured and outgoing. A bright spark, but not so clever; a smart alec mischief-maker dressed in a charity-shop mohair suit and parka jacket, swerving studies for my A-levels in a school that had bored me to tears. But the pair of us were joined at the hip through a shared love of music, <i>Monty Python</i> sketches and our juvenile humour. And then I made the decision that would change both our lives forever.<br><br> <i>Yog, we&#x2019;re forming a band&nbsp;</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the best part of two years, it had been all I&#x2019;d thought about, and having spent so much time in each other&#x2019;s pockets at school, there was only one person I wanted to play music with: the boy set to become George Michael. He had great rhythm and feel, an outstanding sense of melody and he was an even better singer. During our early friendship we&#x2019;d idolised the same bands and artists, a wide variety of music from favourites like Queen to new sounds from the likes of Manchester&#x2019;s Joy Division. By 1979, we were into ska, a very modern British take on reggae that mixed Caribbean grooves with jagged guitars. Bands such as The Specials, Madness, The Beat and Steel Pulse had captured our imaginations, not just musically but through their clothes, too. With a mod revival also under way following the release of the movie <i>Quadrophenia</i>, kids across England were suddenly dressing in sharp suits and Hush Puppies shoes. Buzz cuts were a cool choice at the hairdresser&#x2019;s. Luckily my life in suburban Hertfordshire was as tuned in to the scene as the kids clubbing in London or Birmingham. <i>Music was something I wanted to be a part of.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;But, Andy,&#x2019; said Yog when I called him after school, &#x2018;I want to, but I can&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were some mumbled excuses about A-level pressure and the unforgiving mood of his parents, who seemed eager to protect him from any further distractions&nbsp;&#x2013; like me. However, I wasn&#x2019;t about to be deterred. I&#x2019;d set my heart on this course of action and I wasn&#x2019;t about to let Yog&#x2019;s concerns about his mum and dad thwart it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No, it&#x2019;s now or never,&#x2019; I told him. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re forming a band today.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br> Yog knew I could be single minded, especially once my mind was set on something. He also understood that I wasn&#x2019;t actually asking him, <i>I was telling him</i>. Sensing that I wasn&#x2019;t about to give up, his resistance fizzled away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;OK, Andy,&#x2019; he said, taking a deep breath. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yog was in. Now I had something to be excited about, a goal to achieve&nbsp;&#x2013; <i>a purpose</i>. As far as I was concerned, there was nothing we couldn&#x2019;t do and nobody that would stand in our way. Our friendship was invincible, and to my mind chart success awaited. I had no idea what that success would actually mean, but I could feel it. <i>I knew it.</i> What eventually took place was more spectacular than I could ever have imagined&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>Married...But Lonely: Stop Merely Existing.

Such actions ultimately serve to discredit the Watchtower Society, for no true follower of God finds it comfortable to bear such false witness.&nbsp;</li><li>Unfortunately, I must also report that many Jehovah's Witnesses have been spreading the idea that I myself am a former Jehovah's Witness, which is absolutely not true. I understand why they do this. The Jehovah's Witnesses teach that reading a book by a former Jehovah's Witness is worse than reading pornography. So, one way of preventing other Jehovah's Witnesses from reading this book is by claiming I'm a former Jehovah's Witness.

Breathtaking and magical artwork by Eric Puybaret--who painted the critically-acclaimed illustrations that helped turn PUFF, THE MAGIC DRAGON into a blockbuster bestseller--will carry young readers from a little red farmhouse up over the rainbow, into the sky where bluebirds fly and castles rise high in the clouds, and beyond.<br><br>The extraordinary soundtrack for this book is performed by Judy Collins, who has recorded what might be the very best version of "Over the Rainbow" ever sung. The winner of a Grammy Award, Collins' glorious voice is one of the most admired of the 20th and 21st centuries. Her version of this classic will delight and touch the heart of every parent and child who listens. As an added bonus, the enclosed CD also contains two delightful additional songs recorded by Judy Collins: "White Choral Bells" and "I See the Moon."</p><p>Composer Harold Arlen and lyricist E.Y. Harburg were two of Broadway and Hollywood&#x2019;s most popular songwriters. They wrote the songs for the classic film The Wizard of Oz, for which they won an Academy Award�. Judy Collins has thrilled audiences worldwide for nearly five decades with her magnificent voice and thoughtful interpretations. Many of Collins&#x2019;s albums have been certified platinum and her version of Joni Mitchell&#x2019;s "Both Sides Now" has been entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Her rendition of Stephen Sondheim&#x2019;s "Send in the Clowns" won Grammy&#x2019;s Song of the Year in 1975. Judy's film about Antonia Brico, co-directed by Jill Godmillow, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1974. Brico was Judy's classical piano teacher when she was young and was the first woman to conduct major symphonies around the world. In 2000, Judy founded her own record label, Wildflower Records. In 2010 she enjoyed two huge successes with the New York Times best-selling picture books and CD version of OVER THE RAINBOW, illustrated by Eric Puybaret, and her latest album, Paradise, a collection of ten songs, including duets with Stephen Stills and Joan Baez.Grade 1&#x2013;5&#x2014;A musical classic inspires the creation of new images of sweeping horizons and fanciful creatures. The book includes a CD by singer Judy Collins. Her crystal-clear voice floats seamlessly through the lyrics, first as a solo, then joined by her piano accompaniment, broadening with succeeding lines and natural rhythmic interpretation of the words. Two additional songs interpreted by Collins make this brief CD a treasure&#x2014;"I See the Moon" (with children's chorus) and "White Coral Bells." Readers are treated to deep jewel tones as Puybaret carefully pulls them from one image to another with a succession of dreamlike scenes&#x2014;from a red barn and farmhouse to animated castles in the sky. Clouds and celestial objects float earthward to join a young girl on a journey beyond a rainbow into the upper atmosphere with dreams of impossibilities. The art is unique, delicate, and detailed. Raindrops fall with whisper-thin lines, elongated figures accentuate the hurried action and sweep of the wind, images appear in the clouds, a small child sleeps under the watchful eye of a parent amid musical notes along the path of the rainbow, and bluebirds become elongated creatures of grace. Reading this book with the CD requires awareness of traditionally repeated lines but adds to the shared experience.&#x2014;<i>Mary Elam, Learning Media Services Plano ISD, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That was the year a scrawny, short, flat-chested unknown named Kate Moss was signed as the face of Calvin Klein, demolishing the reign of Amazonian supermodels and saving the house in the process. That was the year Alexander McQueen, a pudgy vulgarian from the East London projects, showed his thesis collection at Central Saint Martins, London&#x2019;s famed design school. He called it &#x201c;Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims,&#x201d; and it was twisted and warped and witty and sent the London press into paroxysms of outrage. And that was the year an emerging young design star named Marc Jacobs, three years into his job as VP of design at Perry Ellis, got an unusual phone call.<br> <br>The man on the other end of the line was Nick Egan, a graphic artist from London with an impressive rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll pedigree. Egan had worked with the Clash, the Ramones, Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, and staged some of Marc&#x2019;s early shows. Now Egan was directing music videos, and he needed a favor.<br> <br>Would Marc let him use his space at Perry Ellis? Egan was working with a band called Sonic Youth&#x2014;Marc wasn&#x2019;t overly familiar&#x2014;and they needed a place to shoot. Also, could they use this collection that Marc was about to show, maybe even film some models walking in the pieces?<br> <br>Marc was dubious. He was under enormous stress, and this collection that Egan wanted to use&#x2014;it was unprecedented, Marc knew it. But at twenty-nine, he was a good generation removed from the girls he was designing for. Marc had come of age at clubs like Studio 54 and Hurrah, places that didn&#x2019;t even exist anymore, and this collection mainlined a new kind of cool, one that a major designer had yet to interpret. Marc knew it could be the defining collection of his young, sun-kissed career: Like nobody else in American fashion, he understood this moment in youth culture. There was a smash-and-grab sensibility, a rummaging through thrift shops and discards, and an embrace of dispossessed beauty. It was a pulverizing, almost moralistic rejection of every excess wrought in the 1980s.<br> <br>Marc had been struggling to establish an identity at Perry Ellis, to move the house, sclerotic in its preppy tastefulness, forward&#x2014;if not ahead of the times, at least on track with them. With this work, which would come to be known as &#x201c;the grunge collection,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d cracked it. But Marc was also self-conscious: Would the buyers and critics get what he was doing? Would the girls he was designing for get it? Was it sublime or sacrilege to buy a flannel shirt on St. Mark&#x2019;s Place for two dollars, then ship it off to Italy to have it remade in silk? To turn a utilitarian thermal undershirt into a luxury good made of cashmere? Marc was equally aware that this collection might make him just another great pretender in the pantheon of fashion design, cannibalizing a subculture he knew little about.<br> <br>And what was this band Sonic Youth about, anyway? Why had they zeroed in on him, at this critical time in his professional life? Did they actually like Marc&#x2019;s clothes, or were they trying to mock his studied blend of high and low fashion? As it turned out, Sonic Youth was intimidated by him, and he was intimidated by them, and this was a small example of the larger feeling among kids on the fringe: Nobody felt cool enough. &#x201c;Was I going to be used,&#x201d; Marc said later, &#x201c;as sort of a Seventh Avenue designer who has exploited grunge?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Marc didn&#x2019;t know it, but in 1992 he had a kindred soul in Lee McQueen, then a student at Central Saint Martins. McQueen, too, was an upstart, bored senseless with what was considered fashion. He was a fan of avant-gardists Rei Kawakubo, Martin Margiela, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and Helmut Lang and that was about it, really. McQueen was a happy warrior of dark arts, and he longed to infuse fashion with the things he was most interested in: sex and death, mutilation and contamination, perversion and harm.<br> <br>&#x201c;He always had these horrible Victorian pornography books that he carried around,&#x201d; says his old friend Alice Smith. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where he got them&#x2014;they were these little fat books that he got in a junk shop or something and they were horrible pictures&#x2014;he thought they were amazing&#x2014;of women wearing ball gags and cages over their heads, over-the-top S&amp;M, and he&#x2019;d be going, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t that lovely? Look at this woman in these leg irons!&#x2019; He had quite a distinct idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>McQueen was gifted, and, as the best designers often are, a hustler and a showman. The press always covered the yearly thesis collections shown at Central Saint Martins, and he was determined to stand apart. &#x201c;That show was their launchpad,&#x201d; says Bobby Hillson, who established the MA fashion course at Central Saint Martins and was McQueen&#x2019;s mentor. &#x201c;The students were written up all over the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t enough for McQueen to be written up: His collection had to be the one to electrify. He went to Hillson with his concept: Jack the Ripper. His models were to be the victims, their clothes badges of bloody struggle; Hillson thought it was a shaky idea at best, but she wanted to help.<br> <br>&#x201c;He was doing terrible things to the fabric, and I said, &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t do this with the cheap fabric you&#x2019;ve got.&#x2019; And he said, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t afford anything else!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>And so Hillson went to her cupboard and removed &#x201c;terribly expensive, rich fabrics that had been donated to us. And I said, &#x2018;Take some of these.&#x2019; You know, somebody would&#x2019;ve died if they saw what he did with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>McQueen was slashing and ripping, printing and staining. He was chopping off locks of his hair and sewing them into the clothes, a riff on a Victorian tradition among lovers, who would buy and exchange the locks of prostitutes. He was obsessed by the latter notion, and for as long as he could sewed his own hair into his label.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims&#x201d; was shown in 1992, and it changed McQueen&#x2019;s life forever: In that crowd was a peculiar, fashion-mad English aristocrat named Isabella Blow.<br> <br>She went by &#x201c;Issie,&#x201d; and was so overcome that she told McQueen she wanted to buy the whole collection. She&#x2019;d pay in installments, �100 per, until she owned all six pieces. She told McQueen she&#x2019;d do whatever she could to help; Issie was averse to the nine-to-five, but she had deep connections in the industry and a strong affinity for mongrels and misfits.<br> <br>First, she said, McQueen must change his name. Issie told him that Lee, his first name, was too common for high fashion. She suggested his middle name, Alexander: It was majestic, had some weight and dignity to it. He agreed. It wasn&#x2019;t hard for him to make that change: McQueen would do whatever it took.<br> <br><br> <br>Marc and McQueen weren&#x2019;t the only designers on the bubble in the summer of 1992.<br> <br>Calvin Klein, who&#x2019;d built the ultimate 1980s status brand, was on the verge of bankruptcy by the beginning of the &#x2019;90s, his name diluted through careless and diffuse licensing deals. To save his house, Klein had to become relevant again, and this meant going younger, less crisp and arch&#x2014;almost dirtier. Klein, approaching fifty, trusted his team, who were in their early to mid-twenties and dialed into what was happening on the streets of London and downtown New York: art director Fabien Baron, creative head Neil Kraft, senior art director Madonna Badger, and consultant Carolyn Bessette.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything was up for grabs,&#x201d; says Badger. The central conundrum facing the brand, she says, was how to reframe its overtly sexual DNA in the age of AIDS.<br> <br>The team considered the women they&#x2019;d pinned to their inspiration board as potential new faces of Calvin Klein: women as disparate as Rosie Perez, the short, curvy, Nuyorican actress hot off Spike Lee&#x2019;s Do the Right Thing, and the lithe, elegant supermodel Linda Evangelista, whose arrogance ultimately worked against her. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t wake up for less than $10,000 a day,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said in 1990, and even for a supermodel, such a comment seemed deliberately contemptuous to the rest of the Western world, living, as it was, through a recession and the aftermath of the Gulf war. Evangelista didn&#x2019;t make it past the first round.<br> <br>For a moment, Perez was the front-runner. &#x201c;I remember Carolyn Bessette shooting that down,&#x201d; Badger says. &#x201c;She wanted it to be modern and fresh.&#x201d; Klein trusted Bessette&#x2019;s taste; she was a muse, and he would eventually charge her with casting all his CK shows. In mid-1992, this moment of grunge and grit and &#x2019;70s regression, Bessette was nothing like the minimalist glamazon she became after marrying John F. Kennedy, Jr.: These days, she wore Egyptian musk and no makeup and had competitions with female Calvin staffers to see who could go the longest without washing her hair. Bessette coolly knocked back her own patrician beauty, spurning perfectionism for a warmer, no less artful dishevelment; at heart, she was a downtown girl who loved vodka, Parliaments, and partying at Save the Robots till six in the morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;We were half-hippie, half-natural,&#x201d; Badger says. &#x201c;It was a total sea change, the opposite of the &#x2019;80s.&#x201d; The question was: Could Calvin Klein make squalor sophisticated?<br> <br>There were two other contenders on the inspiration board: Both were European, small and slight, and had an understated, off-kilter beauty. There was Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and pop star best known in the States for dating Lenny Kravitz. The other was Kate Moss, who had just begun appearing in a UK style bible called The Face.<br> <br>For all the physical resemblance&#x2014;egg-shaped faces strafed with stratospheric cheekbones; china-doll physiques; doe eyes and jagged teeth&#x2014;the two girls represented the diverging path of high fashion. Paradis, says Badger, &#x201c;was the one that had that look.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d just starred in ads for Chanel, as a chanteuse in a birdcage, yet the concept itself was already outdated: Putting a young girl in a cage, initially as terrified as any Hitchcock heroine, calmed by a splash of Chanel and unaware of the threat posed by the fluffy white cat alongside her perch&#x2014;it was an atonal choice for 1992, made by an eighty-two-year-old house. Having Paradis watched over by the ghost of Coco Chanel only underscored the campaign&#x2019;s mustiness.<br> <br>But the shots of Kate were radical. Most of them were by an unknown British photographer named Corinne Day, and were unlike anything that would have been classified as fashion. Day favored black-and-white over color, wastrels-as-models with hangover pallors, the clothes falling apart, too big or too small, pillaged from thrift stores and bedroom floors. Her settings were outdoors and down-market, all natural light and awkward poses. Day&#x2019;s work was as considered and manipulated as that Chanel ad, but the effect was the opposite: druggy, filthy, exuberant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Corinne was just attracted to youth culture and wanted to document it,&#x201d; says Corinne&#x2019;s husband, Mark Szaszy. &#x201c;Because you don&#x2019;t get any idea of what youth culture is doing from Vogue.&#x201d;<br> <br>The image that the Klein team kept coming back to was one of Day&#x2019;s, the July 1990 cover shot of Kate from The Face: the sixteen-year-old in close-up, a smile so wide it smushes her eyes nearly shut and reveals almost all the imperfect teeth in her mouth, a spray of freckles visible on the bridge of her nose. As a cover, it broke all the rules. It was black-and-white; Kate wasn&#x2019;t making eye contact with the viewer; she was barefaced. Three years earlier, such imagery would never have reverberated beyond its subculture. In 1992, it was stunning.<br> <br>But Paradis was the known quantity, and she got the offer first. She turned it down, so Klein and his team turned to their second choice: Kate.<br> <br><br> <br>As the final decade of the millennium dawned, there would be no greater expression of the cultural, economic, and social revolutions to come than fashion. What rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll was to the &#x2019;50s, drugs to the &#x2019;60s, film to the &#x2019;70s, and modern art to the &#x2019;80s, fashion was to the &#x2019;90s: the fuse, then the filter.<br> <br>Much of it had to do with the long-escalating interplay between art and fashion, which had existed since the Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli collaborated with Dal�, Cocteau, and Man Ray in the 1930s. The cross-pollinating continued through the modern age, from the founding of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Interview in 1969 to the insurrectionism of Helmut Newton, Vivienne Westwood, and Malcolm McLaren in the &#x2019;70s and Keith Haring, Cindy Sherman, and Jean-Michel Basquiat in the &#x2019;80s. And there was the electrifying emergence of hip-hop, which brought with it a whole new style.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fashion as a significant cultural phenomenon in the &#x2019;90s had to do with an increasing popular awareness in fashion, and the increasing interchanges between fashion and art,&#x201d; says Valerie Steele, director of the Fashion Institute of Technology. All that had come before allowed someone like Alexander McQueen to be recognized as &#x201c;sui generis&#x2014;a phenomenon recognized for being a fashion designer and an artist,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Fashion was increasingly seen as something that penetrates.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alternative culture was simmering by 1991, yet in so many ways, society hadn&#x2019;t moved on from the 1980s: Michael Jackson had just been signed to Sony in a $1 billion deal. The year&#x2019;s biggest acts ranged from the polyester pop of Color Me Badd and New Kids on the Block to the cartoonish hair-metal of Poison, Skid Row, and Extreme. Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the sequel to the 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger original, was the year&#x2019;s top-grossing movie. The year&#x2019;s overarching question was, &#x201c;Will Charles leave Di?&#x201d; A divorced future king, let alone one remarried to his longtime mistress, was unthinkable.<br> <br>Politically, it felt very 1980s too: George H. W. Bush was still in the White House, his reelection a given. The Clarence Thomas&#x2013;Anita Hill hearings broke open a long-delayed discussion about sexual harassment; public opinion polls showed a wide majority of Americans believed Thomas. And in fashion, the trends of the 1980s had yet to give way: shoulder pads, shellacked makeup, and a brittle, sequin-encrusted Dynasty glamour; Lycra and leg warmers as daywear; neon and bulky knits paired with stirrup pants; high-waisted jeans, side parts and suspenders and high-top sneakers&#x2014;all of it prevailed, all of it long past modern. Big houses like Armani and Versace, Ralph Lauren and Bill Blass, dominated the marketplace; beauty was defined by glamazons like Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Claudia Schiffer, and Christy Turlington&#x2014;who, in 1991, was signed to a record-breaking $800,000 contract with Maybelline, requiring only twelve days&#x2019; work per year. &#x201c;We realize the power we have,&#x201d; Turlington said in a 1991 Time magazine cover story. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re making tons and tons of money for these companies, and we know it.&#x201d; According to Karl Lagerfeld, supermodels were the new movie stars: &#x201c;For me, the really great girls today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are like goddesses from the silver screen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They sell dreams.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>But whose dreams?

The life of Yasuko, on whom the black rain fell, is changed forever by periodic bouts of radiation sickness and the suspicion that her future children, too, may be affected.<br>lbuse tempers the horror of his subject with the gentle humor for which he is famous.

He majored in French at Waseda University and joined the School of Fine Arts to pursue a serious interest in painting.

Gbessa, exiled from the West African village of Lai, is starved, bitten by a viper, and left for dead, but still she survives. June Dey, raised on a plantation in Virginia, hides his unusual strength until a confrontation with the overseer forces him to flee. Norman Aragon, the child of a white British colonizer and a Maroon slave from Jamaica, can fade from sight when the earth calls him. When the three meet in the settlement of Monrovia, their gifts help them salvage the tense relationship between the African American settlers and the indigenous tribes, as a new nation forms around them.</p><p>Moore&#x2019;s intermingling of history and magical realism finds voice not just in these three characters but also in the fleeting spirit of the wind, who embodies an ancient wisdom. &#x201c;If she was not a woman,&#x201d; the wind says of Gbessa, &#x201c;she would be king.&#x201d; In this vibrant story of the African diaspora, Moore, a talented storyteller and a daring writer, illuminates with radiant and exacting prose the tumultuous roots of a country inextricably bound to the United States. <i>She Would Be King </i>is a novel of profound depth set against a vast canvas and a transcendent debut from a major new author.</p></p><p><b>Way�tu Moore</b> is the founder of One Moore Book and is a graduate of Howard University, Columbia University, and the University of Southern California.

In the library there is a little librarian&#x2015;and her three assistant owls&#x2015;who helps everyone find the perfect book. The library is always peaceful and quiet . . . until one night when some of the animals stir up a little trouble (and a little fun!) in the Midnight Library.<br>From Kazuno Kohara, creator of the <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated book <i>Ghosts in the House!</i> comes a beautiful book brimming with cozy charm.</p></p><p><p><b>Kazuno Kohara </b>grew up in Japan and studied printmaking in the UK. She lives in Osaka, Japan.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Kohara's latest picture book is tailor-made for pajama storytimes. The Midnight Library is unusual&#x2014;only open from midnight until dawn. Bustling among furry and feathered patrons, a little librarian and her three assistant owls help each and every reader find the perfect book. Acknowledging that modern libraries also function as vibrant community centers where noise is accommodated, the diminutive information professional cheerfully leads a band of musical squirrels to the activity room, where they "played their instruments as loud as they liked." As dawn approaches and the librarian prepares to close down, she patiently persuades a slowly reading tortoise to get a library card and borrow his selection&#x2014;a scene which will ring familiar for many librarians. As in Ghosts in the House (Roaring Brook, 2008), Kohara employs a limited but bold palette for her sightly retro-style linocut illustrations. Thick black lines define the young librarian, her animal patrons, and the angular, teetering stacks of books. Mustard yellow, which serves as the primary color throughout, lends the nighttime setting a coziness and warmth appropriate for snuggling up for storytime. Pops of navy blue accent both the midnight sky glimpsed through windows and the dozens of library books. Kohara achieves something unique with this title: a modern sensibility with a classic aesthetic. A delightful addition to picture book collections.&#x2014;Kiera Parrott, School Library Journal</p><h2>A Gracious Space: Winter: Daily reflections to sustain your homeschooling commitment</h2><p>A Gracious Space: Winter Edition is designed to offer support, encouragement, and guidance to home educators who take on the daunting challenge to educate their children themselves.

Bork, our country's most distinguished conservative scholar, offers a prophetic and unprecedented view of a culture in decline, a nation in such serious moral trouble that its very foundation is crumbling: a nation that slouches not towards the Bethlehem envisioned by the poet Yeats in 1919, but towards Gomorrah.</p><p><em>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</em> is a penetrating, devastatingly insightful expos� of a country in crisis at the end of the millennium, where the rise of modern liberalism, which stresses the dual forces of radical egalitarianism (the equality of outcomes rather than opportunities) and radical individualism (the drastic reduction of limits to personal gratification), has undermined our culture, our intellect, and our morality.</p><p>In a new Afterword, the author highlights recent disturbing trends in our laws and society, with special attention to matters of sex and censorship, race relations, and the relentless erosion of American moral values. The alarm he sounds is more sobering than ever: we can accept our fate and try to insulate ourselves from the effects of a degenerating culture, or we can choose to halt the beast, to oppose modern liberalism in every arena. The will to resist, he warns, remains our only hope.</p></p><p>Robert Bork will go down as one of history's footnotes. Nominated to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan in 1987, he was voted down by the Senate following a no-holds barred confirmation fight. Almost a decade later, he returns to reopen old wounds with <i>Slouching towards Gomorrah</i>, an extended attack against everything liberal. From pop culture and our universities to the church (Protestant and Roman Catholic) and the Supreme Court--the very institution he once fought so hard to join--Bork finds fault wherever he looks. This is a bitter book from a passionate man who has very little good to say about the world he lives in.<blockquote><i>"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born</i>?" --William Butler Yeats, "The Second Coming" </blockquote><p>Welcome to America, 1996, and the "rough beast" that the visionary poet Yeats foresaw in 1919 is now a monster of decadence, a plague several generations in gestation and we as a nation, are now slouching, not towards Bethlehem, but towards Gomorrah, the biblical city burned to the ground for the sinfulness of its people. </p><p>In Robert H. Bork's <i>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</i>, one of our nation's most distinguished conservative scholars offers a prophetic and unprecedented view of a culture in decline, a nation in such serious moral trouble that its very foundation is crumbling. Of our own president Bork writes: </p><blockquote> "Thirty years ago, Clinton's behavior would have been absolutely disqualifying. Since the 1992 election the public has learned far more about what is known euphemistically, as the 'character issue'. Yet none of this appears to affect Clinton's popularity. It is difficult to conclude that something about our moral perceptions and reactions has changed profoundly. If that change is permanent, the implication for our future is bleak." </blockquote> <p>The root of our decline, Bork argues, is the rise of modern liberalism, which stresses the dual forces of radical egalitarianism (the equality of outcomes rather than opportunities) and radical individualism (the drastic reduction of limits to personal gratification). The roots of modern liberalism are deeply embedded in the last two and a half centuries - and perhaps - arise from the very nature of Western civilization itself. </p><p>From the collapse of popular culture to the general weakening of intellect, from the role of the Supreme Court as an agent of modern liberalism to the trouble in religion, from the assault of radical feminism on American institutions and freedoms, to the "killing for convenience" of abortion and euthanasia, Bork has brilliantly encapsulated a nation and a culture on the brink. He courageously sounds an alarm for all Americans. </p><p>To understand our current plight and the direction in which we are moving, Bork believes we must look to the sixties, a decade in which the moral integrity of our nation came under full blown assault. We have never recovered from that attack because the radicals of the Sixties have taken over or heavily modified the cultural institutions they once sought to destroy. </p><p>We can accept our fate and try to insulate ourselves and our loved ones from the devastating effects of a degenerating culture or we can choose to halt the beast, to oppose modern liberalism in every arena. In the view of Robert Bork, an understanding of our problem and the will to resist may be our only hope. </p><p>Robert H. Bork received his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Chicago. He has been a partner at a major law firm, taught constitutional law as the Alexander M. Bickell Professor of Public Law at the Yale law school, served as Solicitor General and as Acting Attorney General of the United States and served as a United States Court of Appeals judge.

She is a musician, performance artist, composer, fiction writer, and filmmaker (her most recent foray, <i>Heart of a Dog</i>, was lauded as an &#x201c;experimental marvel&#x201d; by the Los Angeles Times). Anderson moves seamlessly between the music world and the fine-art world while maintaining her stronghold in both. A true polymath, her interest in new media made her an early pioneer of harnessing technology for artistic purposes long before the technology boom of the last ten years. Regardless of the medium, however, it is exploration of language (and how it seeps into the image) and storytelling that is her m�tier.<br> A few years ago, Anderson began poring through her extensive archive of nearly forty years of work, which includes scores of documentation, notebooks, and sketchbooks. In the process, she rediscovered important work and looked at well-known projects with a new lens. In this landmark volume, the artist brings together the most comprehensive collection of her artwork to date, some of which has never before been seen or published. Spanning drawing, multimedia installations, performance, and new projects using augmented reality, the extensive volume traverses four decades of her groundbreaking art. Each chapter includes commentary written by Anderson herself, offering an intimate understanding of her work through the artist&#x2019;s own words.</p><p><b>Laurie Anderson&nbsp;</b>is a multimedia artist, musician (with more than seven albums), and filmmaker.

Williams investigate the true motives and consequences of the Pilgrim Society. Early members of the Society included J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Paul Warburg, Mortimer I. Schiff, Otto Kahn, and John D. Rockefeller. Although the Pilgrim Society and the powerful men involved are often praised for their philanthropic actions, Howard-Browne and Williams show that the Society was self-serving and subjected the American people to a brutal system of economic tyranny, one which is still in place today. As a sequel to <i>The Killing of Uncle Sam, Killing the Planet </i>is a thoroughly documented and impeccably researched book, with over 1,500 footnotes. It shows how mankind has become enslaved within the Luciferian world system that is managed and controlled by the world&#x2019;s wealthiest families. The book is not full of conspiracy theories but instead, unfortunately for all of humanity, full of gut-wrenching facts.</p><p><b>Dr. Rodney Howard-Browne</b> is one of the founders of Revival Ministries International, The River at Tampa Bay Church, and River Bible Institute.

Could your tennis or golf game use a boost? Do you appear or feel older than your age? Or do you carry yourself in a manner that expresses strength, power, and peak performance to everyone around you?</p><p>In recent years, Pilates has become a popular exercise program, especially among women. Many books on the subject show lithe female bodies stretched across their covers. Top Pilates instructor Daniel Lyon Jr. aims to break the preconception that Pilates only benefits and appeals to women. "This couldn't be further from the truth," he asserts. "Joseph Pilates was a cigar-smoking boxer, acrobat, and gymnast, and he developed his exercise program from that background for men first." Likewise, Lyon designed this book specifically with men in mind, as the number of male Pilates practitioners -- among them professional athletes, actors, businessmen, and other high-profile personalities -- has rocketed to about three million and continues to grow.</p><p>For athletes, working stiffs, and men recovering from injuries, Lyon offers the first comprehensive exercise program of its kind. He walks you through forty "traditional mat" exercises and more than sixty "reformer on the mat" exercises -- each one brilliantly illustrated -- in an inspiring self-guided program that adapts to all experience levels and requires nothing more than floor space, an exercise mat, and the desire to look and feel your best. Using the Pilates method of engaging the strongest parts of the body, or the "powerhouse" (Joseph Pilates's term for the abdominals, hips, lower back muscles, and buttocks), and integrating all other body parts from this core, Lyon's program targets trouble spots for men and helps them achieve strong, lean, masculine physiques.</p><p><em>The Complete Book of Pilates for Men</em> will deliver quick and long-term results to any man who seeks optimal fitness and a competitive edge in all aspects of his life.</p></p><p><p><strong>Daniel Lyon Jr</strong>.'s first Pilates class inspired him to leave his desk job as a trader. He trained with Joseph Pilates's oldest living prot�g� and has been a private Pilates instructor at reaLPilates @ Tribeca Bodyworks ever since. He was also a Pilates instructor for two years at Drago's Gymnasium. Lyon lives in New York City.</p>Former trader turned TriBeCa Pilates instructor Lyon argues men and women are different when it comes to the mat (men have more strength; women are more flexible). Guys tend to be especially tighter in the shoulders, back, legs and hips, so he has crafted a program for them. The idea is simple enough and the information is solid. There's a quick introduction on the history and basic principles underlying Pilates, followed by a section featuring 40 exercises of "traditional Pilates mat work" and another section with 66 more advanced "reformer on the mat" exercises. Accompanied by illustrations of Lyon in action, the exercises are well organized and easy to follow. The more material readers cover, however, the less convinced they'll be of the need for a book on the subject tailored exclusively for men. While it's true that Pilates classes generally have appealed more to women, the same can surely be said for yoga, aerobics and other comparable low-impact workouts. The gender angle makes for a catchy title and a clever hook, but ultimately seems like a bit of a stretch. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The renegade in Joe Hardy had believed that a man must keep his priorities straight, and some rules were made to be broken. He had no problem declaring Opening Day a de facto holiday, regardless of the opinion of the administrators at his son&#x2019;s schools.<br> <br>He would pass this flexibility along to his son.<br> <br>For Dismas, those days in the company of his father, watching big-league baseball in person, were among the most cherished experiences of his young life. It didn&#x2019;t matter that they had occurred in the cramped bandbox of Seals Stadium or the freezing wind tunnel that was Candlestick Park.<br> <br>Great as those days had been, he thought that this one was better.<br> <br>Part of it, of course, was AT&amp;T Park, which to his mind was essentially the platonic ideal of the ballpark. (Although, of course, how could Plato have known?) His seats, courtesy of a client who&#x2019;d moved to Oregon and sold his season tickets to Hardy to keep or sell off as he saw fit, were as good as it got&#x2014;in the last row on the Club Level, fifty feet from the broadcast booths, shaded from the sun and occasional drizzle, mere steps from the closest bar.<br> <br>He looked down at the sun-drenched field, warm and windless at the moment, a half hour to go until game time. Five minutes ago, the band Train had sung &#x201c;Save Me, San Francisco&#x201d; and now attendants were clearing the bandstand from the infield. Some of the players were still doing wind sprints or long toss out in left field.<br> <br>Soon his son Vincent (impossibly, twenty-six years old and playing hooky from his job at Facebook) would return carrying two beers, a couple of bratwurst, and an order of garlic fries.<br> <br>Hardy dabbed at his eye and took a breath against a wash of emotion. By all rights, he knew he shouldn&#x2019;t be here. He shouldn&#x2019;t be alive at all. About a year before, he&#x2019;d taken two bullets&#x2014;one to his chest that had bounced off a rib that deflected it away from his heart, and one superficially to the side of his head&#x2014;bloody but not serious.<br> <br>These last couple of bullet wounds made it four in his lifetime, surely more than the average allotted number for a mostly sedentary sixty-something lawyer, albeit a former Marine whose first experience of getting shot, in the shoulder, had come while he was pulling a guy who would become his brother-in-law out from under enemy fire in Vietnam.<br> <br>But still . . .<br> <br>Four?<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>TROGLODYTE THAT HE was, Hardy had completely turned off his cell phone nearly an hour earlier, as soon as the Opening Day festivities and announcements had begun.<br> <br>Vincent, who could probably survive without air for longer than he could live if he were not connected to the cloud or the World Wide Web or whatever, for the first four innings kept up a steady and knowledgeable patter with his father about the game, his job, his girlfriend Jennifer, and the general state of his physical and mental health&#x2014;all good.<br> <br>At the same time, his thumbs never seemed to stop tapping the face of his iPhone.<br> <br>Finally, with the Giants coming up in the bottom of the fourth, Hardy could stand it no more. &#x201c;Who are you talking to all this time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everybody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.

I mean physically.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what about here, where you are physically?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about it? I&#x2019;m having a great day with my old man, having some brewskis, watching the ball game. I&#x2019;m totally here right now. Bottom of the fourth coming up, three to two, Padres. You&#x2019;re thinking about cutting back to half-time for the summer. The Beck&#x2019;s had two offers to change firms and turned them both down. Mom&#x2019;s joined a women&#x2019;s hiking club and you think they&#x2019;re pushing it too hard. But if you want, I can go dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not necessary.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;d prefer it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Hardy lied. In fact, he would have preferred it, but far more important to him was that he didn&#x2019;t alienate his son, to whom this was the norm, and who was, after all, living in the world in which he&#x2019;d been raised. &#x201c;I just need to get used to it. Multitasking in the modern age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you already are. Here we are, watching the game, you and me catching up on the home stuff, enjoying our beer. I&#x2019;d call that multitasking, too. Wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; He looked down at his phone and chuckled.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Hardy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just a text from Ron.&#x201d; His roommate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Saying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You really want to know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Why&#x2019;d the cowboy buy a dachshund?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I give up. Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He wanted to get a long little doggie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hardy&#x2019;s lips twitched up slightly. &#x201c;Good one,&#x201d; he said, though not, he thought, necessarily worth the interruption.<br> <br>Like so much of the rest of it.<br> <br>But continuing to push the conversation in that vein, he knew, was not going to be a fruitful line of discussion. He was just an old fart, unfamiliar and&#x2014;it seemed suddenly, only in the past couple of years&#x2014;slightly uncomfortable with the way so many of the young people he knew were living.<br> <br>He was the one who had to get over it, change with the times, go with the flow. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, getting to his feet, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on a mission for another beer. You want one?&#x201d;<br> <br>Vincent&#x2019;s thumbs were back flying over his phone&#x2019;s screen; looking up for the briefest of instants, he nodded absently. &#x201c;Sounds great.&#x201d;</p><h2>Vivian Maier: Self-Portraits</h2><p>The follow-up to the international smash hit.

Seemingly without a family of her own, the children she cared for eventually acted as caregivers for Maier herself in the autumn of her life. She took hundreds of thousands of photographs in her lifetime, but never shared them with anyone. Maier lost possession of her art when her storage locker was sold off for non-payment. She passed away in 2009 at the age of 83.<br> <b><br>John Maloof</b> is a filmaker and street photographer.

Among the criteria the act set was a blood quantum, which declared that &#x201c;Indians&#x201d; were "all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood". Today, many tribes wrestle with the legacy of blood quantum and &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; identity, as they work to manage tribal enrollment and social services. As the bloodlines grow increasingly diluted, within a few generation, recognized tribes might legally disappear.&nbsp;Through essays, personal stories, case studies, satire, and poetry, <i>The Great Vanishing Act</i>&nbsp;brings together writers from around the world to explore the biological and cultural metaphor of blood quantum, the most critical issue facing Indigenous populations in the twenty-first century.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Norbert S.

And when she does, she&#x2019;s faced with something she&#x2019;s never seen before: a terrifyingly ordinary group of people&#x2014;kids, grandparents, soccer moms&#x2014;all recently turned and willing to die to avoid serving a master. And where there&#x2019;s one martyr, there will be more...<br><br>But even vampires have monsters that they&#x2019;re afraid of. And Anita is one of them...</p><p><p></p><strong>A conversation with Charlaine Harris, best-selling author of Deadlocked, and Laurell K. Hamilton, best-selling author of Kiss the Dead</strong><p></p> <p><strong>Question: Did you ever imagine that your series would run as long as it has?</strong></p> <p><strong>Charlaine Harris:</strong> I was just glad to sell the first book. It took two years of my agent sending it out to get a bite. I never even dreamed that Sookie would be so popular, that I would find so much to say about her and her world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Laurell K. Hamilton: </strong> No. I had over two hundred rejections for the first Anita Blake novel. They were the nicest rejections, with editors suggesting other publishing houses to send it to, but they, themselves, couldn't figure out how to market it. When I got that first three book contract, I remember thinking, "Well, at least I'll get to write three of them." I actually did think I had at least ten books in Anita and her world, but I don't think anyone can plan to write twenty-one novels in a series and still be excited about starting the twenty-second.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Did you ever dream paranormal would be this hot?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> I remember being told that mixed genre didn't sell, before the term paranormal became a genre. I was also told that no one wanted to read about vampires. More than one editor told me that particular monster was dead and gone. I thought there was life left in the old legends, but I never saw this level of popularity coming. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Yes, even my agent didn't expect <i>Dead Until Dark</i> would be an easy sell, maybe especially since my books contained a lot of humor. Vampires were pass�, and books that crossed genres (Except for yours: I think you had three or four books out when I wrote the first Sookie, and I was so glad to discover them!) were called "unshelvable.&#x2019; I could never have anticipated shelves and shelves of cross-genre books. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Does fan response play a part in your planning process?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> Not in the sense of changing plot direction in my novels. This is my story to tell, and I have to write it the way I see it. But every now and then when reader response to a character is unexpectedly enthusiastic--or the opposite--I'll take a second look at that character to see why he/she is coming across in a way I didn't expect or anticipate. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I don't change plot direction for fan reaction either. My story, my world, my books, my stuff, my way. The only people who can change the direction of my novels are my characters. It's their life, after all, so if they're really insistent on a different plot, then they win. I agree that reader response to a character can make me puzzle over them more, but it doesn't usually change how often the character is on stage, or how big their role is, because weirdly if the fans are interested, then I'm already intrigued. Best example is Edward who started out as this cold blooded assassin, almost a bad guy, and now he's one of Anita's best friends, and he's a U. S. Marshal. So, not what I had planned for him. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Have you ever had a character totally surprise you with their choices?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> A lot of my characters have minds of their own. Edward went away on his own and got himself engaged to a woman with two children from her first marriage. Edward-- assassin, ex-military, current police officer, taking a six-year-old to ballet lessons with all the other moms both amuses and hurts my head. Anita's love life went into a completely different direction than I'd ever anticipated. I so didn't see Anita dating this many men, or being in love with more than one man, and having everyone she loved okay with that. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> I've discovered some surprising things about my characters as I wrote them. I know that their minds are really my mind, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. It's like knowing a character has a secret (I'm thinking of Bill), and then suddenly realizing what that secret is. I was genuinely aghast. Sometimes my creative brain thinks a lot faster than my conscious brain. And it's certainly a lot more devious. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you keep a world with paranormal elements credible?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> I anchored my skewed world with real-life elements. Sookie has to pay her bills, she has to do her laundry, and she has family obligations. My vampires buy their clothes at the mall. My werewolf runs a surveying business. One of my fairies works in customer service at a department store. Readers seem to enjoy the fact that no matter what creature you may be, there's a process of surviving that has to be gone through; but there's all these other elements that make that process so different. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I make sure any real life facts are as real and well-researched as possible. Because I'm asking people to believe in vampires, wereanimals, and zombies, I need to make sure the guns, cars, and real crime are as realistic as possible. Once a reader catches me wrong in an area where they are expert they won't believe my monsters are real. But I have found if I'm right on the hard facts even experts will let me fudge, or take that next fantastic leap, because I've proven myself by laying the foundation of reality to make my leap into the unknown. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Do people ever expect you to be your characters?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> If I had known people would get confused between fiction and fact I'd have made Anita look less like me, but it just never occurred to me that there would be a problem. I've had fans want to know what weapons I'm carrying. They assume all the men are based on real people, and they aren't. I don't actually base characters on real people. Since I can't lighten Anita's hair, I've lightened my own and I get less fan confusion. I've had fans ask for the phone numbers of the men and get angry when I tried to explain I couldn't give them the contact info for a fictional character. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Ha! Well, I'm much older and rounder than Sookie, so I'm definitely no stand-in for Sookie. In fact, readers who have never met me before are usually astonished when they meet me; so were the actors on <i>True Blood</i>. Some of my readers who came to me after watching <i>True Blood</i> get the characters in the books sort of conflated with the actors who play them on television. In their minds, Alexander Skarsgard IS Eric, Stephen Moyer IS Bill. It can lead to some confusing questions when I'm at signings. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What scenes in your novels are the most fun for you to write? Action? Sex? Relationship drama?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> All of those are fun, depending on the outcome! But I have to say, I love to write a good fight scene. I find the "relationship" scenes a challenge. When people talk about their relationships, it's a messy conversation. People aren't too articulate about their innermost feelings. And such conversations don't proceed in a linear way, but jag back and forth as each speaker voices the issues that are most important to that person. So it's hard to make sound realistic, coherent, and yet condense such a conversation enough to make it tolerable. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> It depends on my mood. Sometimes a good fight scene can be very therapeutic, and give a productive outlet for negative emotions. The more people involved in the action the more complex the fight choreography can become, and that can be a challenge, and slow down the emotional content for me. I enjoy doing sex scenes, but they are a different kind of challenge. On a day when I can get in the mood for the scene, they&#x2019;re great, but on a day when real life interferes, it&#x2019;s a bit like real sex. It&#x2019;s hard to concentrate on it when you have too many interruptions from the non-sexy side of your life. I guess that&#x2019;s true of all writing, though, too many interruptions disrupt the process in general. The biggest challenge for the sex scenes is that sex is a very personal and individual activity, so I have the same girl involved, but different men and I want each man&#x2019;s style to be unique. Relationship drama? Yuck, can I just say, yuck again? This kind of drama isn&#x2019;t fun in real life and the only thing that makes fictional relationship drama tolerable is that it&#x2019;s fictional, and I&#x2019;m not having to endure it in my real life, but other than that it sucks just as much. It also tends to complicate my life as a writer, because almost nothing screws up a story arc like relationship choices, though I have had action scenes go so differently from what I&#x2019;d planned that an entire third of a book had to be thrown out. It was a better book for it, but still, near deadline that was hard. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What&#x2019;s the hardest thing about writing such a long running series?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> The beginning of the book is easy, because you always want that to be interesting and lure in both old and new readers. It&#x2019;s the middle of the book that becomes more complicated. As a writer you always have to think that you may have brand new readers picking up your book, so you have to explain the characters, the world, everything, but you don&#x2019;t want to over explain to the long time readers. The other problem with a series is that each book needs to stand alone as much as possible, but you also want character growth and world development from novel to novel, so again, it&#x2019;s a balancing act. I make sure that each opening is different enough that you won&#x2019;t be left wondering, did I read that already. It&#x2019;s an issue I&#x2019;ve had with other series that I read. It gets very challenging when you get in double digits to make everything fresh, but familiar. I&#x2019;m lucky that I&#x2019;m still discovering new things about Anita, Jean-Claude, Edward, Nathaniel, everyone, and the world continues to grow and surprise me. My fictional world is like the real one, I never know quite what&#x2019;s coming next. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH:</strong> The hardest thing is keeping track of previous developments and details. My memory just wasn't up to it, and I had to hire someone (the fabulous Victoria Koski). When you create a world, there are a thousand small things that make it credible, and it's easier than you'd think to forget whether someone is a werefox or a werelynx, or whether it's still daytime during the narrative or if you've passed into darkness. I think it's important to catch as many little errors as you can, so readers don't get yanked out of the world. I'm not the kind of reader who notices, but there are many readers who do.</p><p> </p><p>Photo Laurell K. Hamilton � Stefan Hester</p> <p>Photo Charlaine Harris � Sigrid Estrada</p><b>Laurell K.

Girouard ( Life in the English Country House ) explains how the multitudinous small, separate plots of the medieval town still condition the variegated plan and appearance of towns throughout the country. Innumerable streets, quays and marketplaces follow medieval models. Georgian towns introduced a new vastness of scale, with public walks and planted squares, assembly halls, mills and docks. Even as Enlightenment-influenced planners made towns more geometric, parks and open spaces interpenetrated with buildings. Decked out with paintings, drawings and photographs, this panorama reveals what is distinctively English about the towns explored. History Book Club and Readers' Subscription Book Club alternates. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Long interested in the historical development of agricultural towns, cathedral cities, mill villages, and resort spas, Girouard brings to life the richness and fascination of English towns in this handsomely designed and beautifully illustrated study. While the origins and evolution of features that comprise places--the town hall, warehouses, terraces and squares, backstreets and alleys, parks, and marketplaces--are described in separate chapters, one has the sense of the whole being greater than the sum of the individual parts. Girouard's scholarship and extensive knowledge, augmented by extensive paintings, drawings, plans, and photographs, combine to create an unforgettable portrait of an endangered species: the English town.<br><i>- H.

In his book, Vogler, borrowing ideas from Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, argues that every story follows certain patterns--which he collectively characterizes as a mythic "hero's journey." In <i>Myth and the Movies</i>, Voytilla breaks this journey up into stages, using 50 famous films to illustrate the universality of Vogler's method. During the course of the book, he unpacks the mythic structure of horror, war, drama, romance, comedy, science fiction, action-adventure, the western, and the thriller, drawing on films as diverse as <i>Seven Samurai</i>, <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, <i>Annie Hall</i>, and <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>. His charts, maps, and consideration of various archetypal characters ("the shadow," "the trickster," "the herald," "the shapeshifter") and narrative devices ("the elixir," "the adventure," "the threshold," "the road back") provide a clear picture of how Campbell's archetypes can be used for film analysis. And who knows? Perhaps as you follow Voytilla's descriptions, you will be inspired to create some myths of your own. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i>Voytilla is a writer, script consultant, and teacher of acting and screenwriting.</p><h2>Frontier Justice: The Rise and Fall of the Loomis Gang</h2><p>A definitive history of the Loomis Gang who terrorized central New York in the 1800&#39;s.

In this beautiful and richly illustrated book, the acclaimed author of <i>Blue</i> now tells the fascinating social history of the color black in Europe.</p><br><p> In the beginning was black, Michel Pastoureau tells us. The archetypal color of darkness and death, black was associated in the early Christian period with hell and the devil but also with monastic virtue. In the medieval era, black became the habit of courtiers and a hallmark of royal luxury. Black took on new meanings for early modern Europeans as they began to print words and images in black and white, and to absorb Isaac Newton's announcement that black was no color after all. During the romantic period, black was melancholy's friend, while in the twentieth century black (and white) came to dominate art, print, photography, and film, and was finally restored to the status of a true color.</p><br><p> For Pastoureau, the history of any color must be a social history first because it is societies that give colors everything from their changing names to their changing meanings--and black is exemplary in this regard. In dyes, fabrics, and clothing, and in painting and other art works, black has always been a forceful--and ambivalent--shaper of social, symbolic, and ideological meaning in European societies.</p><br><p> With its striking design and compelling text, <i>Black</i> will delight anyone who is interested in the history of fashion, art, media, or design.</p></p><p><b>Michel Pastoureau</b> is a historian and director of studies at the �cole Pratique des Hautes �tudes de la Sorbonne in Paris. He is the author of many books, including <i>Blue: The History of a Color</i> (Princeton) and <i>The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes</i>.<b>"Winner of the 2009 Bronze Medal in Fine Art, Independent Publisher Book Awards"</b><br><br><b>"One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 2009"</b><br><br>"Who would have thought the history of a single color could be so fascinating? <i>Black: The History of a Color</i>, by Michel Pastoureau, (Princeton University Press, $35) proceeds chronologically from cave painting to modern fashion and focuses on mythology, heraldry, religion, science and painting along the way. The author, a historian at the Sorbonne, narrates developments in the material, aesthetic and sociological dimensions of the color black with infectious, wide-ranging curiosity and easy-going erudition. After this you'll want to read his previous book, from the same publisher, <i>Blue: The History of a Color</i>."<b>---Ken Johnson, <i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>"Praise for Michel Pastoureau's <i>Blue</i>: "Pastoureau's text moves us through one fascinating area of activity after another. . . . The jacket, cover and end-papers of this luscious book are appropriately blue; its double-columned text breathes easily in the space of its pages; it is so well sewn it opens flat at any place; and fascinating, aptly chosen color plates, not confined to the title color, will please even those eyes denied the good luck of being blue.""<b>---William H. Gass, author of, <i>Blue: A Philosophical Inquiry</i></b><br><br>"This handsome, strikingly designed, richly illustrated book traces the history of the color black in Europe. . . . Like his earlier <i>Blue</i>, this book is well researched, skillfully written, and a pleasure to read."<b>---R. M. Davis, <i>Choice</i></b><br><br>"Michael Pastoureau, in <i>Black: The History of a Color</i>, sees the rise of puritanism and Protestantism as the war of the colours--a war against vivid colour that black usually won. . . . He has a terrific story to tell, and a multitude of gorgeous images to help tell it."<b>---Robert Fulford, <i>The National Post</i></b><br><br>"<i>Black</i> is a penetrating, erudite, thoughtfully illustrated cultural history of a color, by Michel Pastoureau, an author whose earlier work has included--surprise, surprise--<i>Blue</i>."<b>---Nicholas A. Basbanes, <i>The Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette</i></b><br><br>"French popular art historian Pastoureau here tackles one of the most complex and interesting colours, the favourite of 'priests and penitents, artists and ascetics, fashion designers and fascists.' This social history is lavishly illustrated with paintings, movie stills, photo portraits and fashion shoots." (<i>The Globe &amp; Mail</i>)<br><br>"Until I came upon Michel Pastoureau's 2000 book <i>Blue: The History of a Color</i> it had never occurred to me colors had a history. Turns out they do, and tracking the significance first of blue, now black, provides a satisfyingly fresh angle of approach to the past."<b>---Frtiz Lanham, <i>The Houston Chronicle</i></b><br><br>"What is interesting in sociological histories like Pastoureau's is their revelations about how cultural attitudes change. Black's connection with death began as early as ancient Egypt, when people left black stones on funeral pyres, not in a ghoulish way but as a symbol of rebirth (the Egyptian death divinity, Anubis, was painted black). . . . But this book will have you seeing black in more shades than you imagined."<b>---Victor Swoboda, <i>The Montreal Gazette</i></b></p><h2>Japanese for Busy People I: The Workbook for the Revised 3rd Edition (Japanese for Busy People Series)</h2><p><i>Japanese for Busy People</i> is the most popular Japanese language textbook series in the world.

He was the great-nephew of the playwright Richard Sheridan. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and called to the bar in 1839, but chose instead to pursue a career in journalism. He began his writing career by publishing a number of stories anonymously in the Dublin University Magazine, which had been founded in 1833 by a group of Trinity College students. Le Fanu went on to purchase the magazine in 1861 and became its editor. From 1840 onwards he bought and edited the Warden and the Protestant Guardian, among other magazines and newspapers.<br><br>His first two novels, The Cock and Anchor (1845) and Torlogh O'Brien (1847), followed the style of Sir Walter Scott. After purchasing the Dublin University Magazine, in which much of his writing was serialized, he wrote the tales that made him a bestseller. These novels use mystery and the supernatural to explore the psychological effects of fear, and often deal with a young, innocent person being drawn into a dangerous situation in which older people conspire to swindle and harm them, as in Uncle Silas (1864). His other works include The House by the Churchyard (1863), Wylder's Hand (1864), The Wyvern Mystery (1869) and The Rose and the Key (1871). In 1872 he collected and published the remarkable stories of In a Glass Darkly, including the famous story of a female vampire, 'Carmilla', which predates Bram Stoker's Dracula by 25 years and formed the basis of the 1932 film Vampyr. After his death in 1873, Le Fanu's works faded in popularity, but interest was revived in 1923 when a collection of stories was published, entitled Madam Crowl's Ghost and Other Tales of Mystery.</p><h2>Options, Futures, and Other Derivative Securities</h2><p>Provides a logical, unifying approach to the valuation and hedging of all derivative securities, not just financial futures and stock options.</p><p></p><h2>Religion in the Ancient Greek City</h2><p>This book is an English translation of the French work La Religion Grecque.

His revised, in-depth account of the region reveals dynamic societies more concerned about corruption and climate change, the uncertainties of a Donald Trump-led United States, and a political cycle that, in many cases, is turning from left-wing populism to center-right governments. This essential new edition provides important insights into the sweeping changes that have occurred in Latin America in recent years and indicates priorities for the future.</p><p><b>Michael Reid </b>is Latin American columnist and a senior editor for <i>The Economist.</i><i></i>He is the author of <i>Brazil: The Troubled Rise of a Global Power</i> (2014), also published by Yale.

Color keys make it easy to find the right group. *Range maps show where and when to see each bird throughout the year.</p><p>World-renowned birder Kenn Kaufman addresses a long-running paradox of bird field guides with his <i>Focus Guide</i>. While beginning birdwatchers prefer photographic guides like those by Donald Stokes, the physical traits that make identification easier are more readily discerned in the idealized paintings of illustrative guides like those by Roger Tory Peterson and National Geographic. Kaufman's groundbreaking work combines the best of both approaches by digitally enhancing photographic images to show the characteristics that are sometimes not apparent in photographs. <p> Some other distinguishing features include: </p><ul> <li>The guide is organized by bird family groupings rather than strict taxonomic classification; this is a feature that will appeal especially to beginners. </li><li>Text descriptions and range maps for each species appear on the page facing the plate of respective bird images. </li><li>Important field marks are highlighted. </li><li>Color-coded tabs identify each grouping of birds (waders, warblers, sparrows, etc.) for quick thumb indexing. </li></ul> Kaufman's efforts follow the auspicious tradition of Roger Tory Peterson, whose portable field guide system was the first of its kind to meet the needs of the average birdwatcher. "It's the guide I've always wanted," says Kaufman, "and I suspect most birders will feel the same way."Kenn Kaufman is a legend among birders. At sixteen he hitchhiked back and forth across North America, traveling eighty thousand miles in a year, simply to see as many birds as he could; he came back to tell the story in KINGBIRD HIGHWAY. A field editor for AUDUBON and a regular contributor to every major birding magazine, he is the youngest person ever to receive the Ludlow Griscom Award, the highest honor of the American Birding Association. His natural history pursuits have taken him to all seven continents, but he has made a special study of North American birds. His books include LIVES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS, the PETERSON FIELD GUIDE TO ADVANCED BIRDING, and the FOCUS GUIDE TO BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA. He resides in Tucson, Arizona.</p><h2>The Carnivore Way: Coexisting with and Conserving North America&#39;s Predators</h2><p>What would it be like to live in a world with no predators roaming our landscapes? Would their elimination, which humans have sought with ever greater urgency in recent times, bring about a pastoral, peaceful human civilization? Or in fact is their existence critical to our own, and do we need to be doing more to assure their health and the health of the landscapes they need to thrive?&nbsp;In&nbsp;<i>The Carnivore Way</i>, Cristina Eisenberg argues compellingly for the necessity of top predators in large, undisturbed landscapes, and how a continental-long corridor&#x2014;a &#x201c;carnivore way&#x201d;&#x2014;provides the room they need to roam and connected landscapes that allow them to disperse. Eisenberg follows the footsteps of six large carnivores&#x2014;wolves, grizzly bears, lynx, jaguars, wolverines, and cougars&#x2014;on a 7,500-mile wildlife corridor from Alaska to Mexico along the Rocky Mountains.

Taylor skillfully describes the weapons and their roles in tribal culture, economy, and political systems. He categorizes the weapons according to their function--from striking, cutting, and piercing weapons to those with defensive and even symbolic properties, and he documents the ingenuity of the people who crafted them. <p></p>Taylor explains the history and use of weapons such as the atlatl, a lethal throwing stick whose basic design was enhanced by carving, painting, or other ornamentation. The atlatl surprised De Soto's expedition and contributed to the Spaniards' defeat. Another highlight is Taylor's description of the evolution of body armor, first fashioned to defend against arrows, then against bullets from early firearms. <p></p>Over thousands of years the weapons were developed and creatively matched to their environment--highly functional and often decorative, carried proudly in tribal gatherings and in war.</p><p>Colin F. Taylor, formerly a Senior Lecturer at Hastings College of Arts and Technology, England, is a writer, lecturer, and film consultant. He is the author of <i>Buckskin and Buffalo: The Artistry of the Plains Indians</i>, coauthor of <i>With Eagle Tail,</i> editor of <i>Native American Arts and Crafts,</i> and coeditor of <i>The Native Americans: The Indigenous People of North America.</i>In this taut and generously illustrated overview, Taylor (Buckskin and Buffalo: The Artistry of the Plains Indians) zeroes in on North American Indian arms and armor from prehistoric times to the late 19th century, dividing his subject into five efficient categories. The chapter on striking weapons covers war clubs and tomahawks, cutting weapons include knives from Folsom stone to Bowie, piercing weapons comprise spears and bows and arrows, and defensive weapons feature the seldom-emphasized armor both men and horses wore in battle. Most interesting, however, is the chapter on symbolic weapons, which describes how powerful icons on dress or ornament were used to ward off blows. The illustrations mostly color photos of objects help the reader see distinctions between, for example, a regular tomahawk and a spontoon or French one. Old paintings and photographs show the weapons held by their owners, giving both a time frame and a sense of their importance. The text is packed and yet very readable, and the amount of history, tribal distinction, and construction detail given in such a short book is astounding. This excellent introduction is a bargain for any library.

Both dramatize the process of self-renewal in nature and resolutely rail against the official culture and politics of the "trivial Nineteenth Century." Blending keen observation with a wealth of perceptive and informed reflections, Thoreau develops a continuous and lyrical dialogue between the past and present, as particular scenes on shore trigger reflections on the region's history and legends. <br>Originally conceived as a travel book, <i>A Week</i> eventually became much more &#x2014; one of the most intellectually ambitious works of 19th-century America, and a requiem for Thoreau's brother John, who died from a sudden illness in 1842.<br>Of Thoreau and this work, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "H.

Often neglected in the various curricula of design schools, the new models of design research described in this book help designers to investigate people, form, and process in ways that can make their work more potent and more delightful. "At the very least," Peter Lunenfeld writes in the preface, "design research saves us from reinventing the wheel. At its best, a lively research methodology can reinvigorate the passion that so often fades after designers join the profession." </p><p>The goal of the book is to introduce designers to the many research tools that can be used to inform design as well as to ideas about how and when to deploy them effectively. The chapter authors come from diverse institutions and enterprises, including Stanford University, MIT, Intel, Maxis, Studio Anybody, Sweden's HUMlab, and Big Blue Dot. Each has something to say about how designers make themselves better at what they do through research, and illustrates it with real world examples&#x2015;case studies, anecdotes, and images. Topics of this multi-voice conversation include qualitative and quantitative methods, performance ethnography and design improvisation, trend research, cultural diversity, formal and structural research practice, tactical discussions of design research process, and case studies drawn from areas as unique as computer games, museum information systems, and movies. Interspersed throughout the book are one-page "demos," snapshots of the design research experience. <i>Design Research</i> charts the paths from research methods to research findings to design principles to design results and demonstrates the transformation of theory into a richly satisfying and more reliably successful practice.</p></p><p>Brenda Laurel is Chair of the graduate Media Design Program at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California and was the co-founder of Purple Moon.

In Bern, she attended the Freies Gymnasium and spoke not only fluent French and German but also English, which was the language spoken to her by her American parents. After World War II, Dr. McCuen-Metherell's parents sent her and her brother to Pacific Union College (in California's Napa Valley), where she received a B. A. in English. She taught English and French in high school for several years and then took night classes at the University of Southern California, where she earned an M.A. and Ph.D. While working on her doctorate, she was hired to teach English at Glendale Community College and later to serve as Dean of the Evening College. A chance meeting in 1973 with Anthony C. Winkler, a successful novelist, led to a literary partnership that has produced 15 coauthored textbooks used at colleges and universities across the United States.<br><br>Born in Kingston, Jamaica West Indies, Anthony C. Winkler was educated in Jamaica at Excelsior College, Mount Alvernia Academy and Cornwall College, the last two being in Montego Bay. He was also educated at Citrus Community College, Glendora, California. Winkler taught briefly at Pasadena City College and for a year at Moneague Teachers College in Saint Anne, Jamaica, an experience chronicled in GOING HOME TO TEACH (1995). From 1968 to 1975 Winkler had sales territories as a bookman for Appleton Century Crofts textbook publishers, and later for Scott, Foresman. In 1969 he decided he could write textbooks as well as anyone. Through a chance meeting with the sales representative of another company, he submitted the manuscript POETRY AS SYSTEM and was offered a contract for its publication. Eventually, he met Jo Ray McCuen-Metherell and the two became textbook writers and collaborators. Over the years they have produced more than a dozen textbooks, most on rhetoric and writing.

One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer.

The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-<br>able hardbound editions of impor-<br>tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-<br>fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring<br>as its emblem the running torch-<br>bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: "Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement.

The fate of this beloved country home symbolizes the future of England itself in E. M. Forster's exploration of social, economic, and philosophical trends, as exemplified by three families: the Schlegels, symbolizing the idealistic and intellectual aspect of the upper classes; the Wilcoxes, representing upper-class pragmatism and materialism; and the Basts, embodying the aspirations of the lower classes.&nbsp;Published in 1910, <i>Howards End</i> won international acclaim for its insightful portrait of English life during the post-Victorian era.</p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Fundamentals of Production Planning and Control</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This focused book concentrates on planning and control; it answers the question: &#x201c;what parts of operations management do we really need to know?&#x201d; It does not bog the reader down with details, but allows them to concentrate on fundamental principles, such as the development and application of software solutions, inventory management, and lean production concepts. <b> </b>&nbsp; Topics include: forecasting, sales and operations, scheduling, materials requirements, capacity management, production control, &#x201c;partnering&#x201d; activities, and system integration. <b> </b> An excellent handbook for operations managers, production control workers, inventory control employees, and those involved in supply chain, logistics, and materials management.</p></p><p></p><h2>New Keywords: A Revised Vocabulary of Culture and Society</h2><p>Over 25 years ago, Raymond Williams&#x2019; <i>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</i> set the standard for how we understand and use the language of culture and society.

Far from a protected and fanciful Tom Sawyer, Clemens, as a three-year-old sleepwalker, tugged at his sisters blanket a few days before she died. She was one of several siblings Sam would lose. Unsuccessful but not evil like Huck Finns papy, Samuels father was relatively bland, passing on only his tendency toward bad debts and investments. Powers shows that young Sam was fascinated by the spoken word (whether of preachers or slaves) and by books, from the Bible (despite his famous heresy) to Cooper, because his reality was so painful. The biographer notes an inner conflict that is the key to Clemenss appeal: ``the Connecticut literary gent contending with the western roughneck.'' After adolescence, itching to light out for the territories, young Clemens ``made the break from his landlocked life'' and talked himself to the captains wheel on riverboats. Powers feels the Mark Twain pseudonym helped free Clemens to become the ages most celebrated humorist, traveler, lecturer and novelist. There are 20 pages of chapter notes, but this biography is too good to be confused with literary criticism. Powers calls out ``mark twain'' and leads us on Samuel Clemenss dangerous, poignant, and delightful voyage against the current. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Much of the sly, entertaining, and sometimes just plain odd poetry that is scattered among Lewis Carroll's books is gathered here. Some of it is excerpted, and there's not always a clear indication of its source. However, there are nice introductions providing a bit of background (the "White Knight's Song"^B is a takeoff on Wordsworth, for example), and the occasional difficult word is glossed at the end of each poem. Eric Copeland's pictures are vigorously painted watercolors that reflect the daft or daffy text well and also support the one or two more serious verses. In a few cases, the text floats over a full illustration and is a bit hard to read. The anthology does provide a rollicking opportunity to read "Jabberwocky" and part of "The Hunting of the Snark" aloud, always a diverting occupation, but it might be more fun to open <i>Alice</i> and, as was said to her, "begin at the beginning." <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For Brown, art was a means of self-revelation and self-investigation, a fact made abundantly clear by the autobiographical nature of her work. In the first book to fully explore Joan Brown's artistic career, Karen Tsujimoto provides an overview of Brown's life from her San Francisco childhood to her years as a mature artist and teacher. Jacquelynn Baas focuses on Brown's use of universal and personal symbolism by analyzing one of her most celebrated paintings, <i>The Bride</i>. Both authors make extensive use of interviews that let Joan Brown speak for herself about art and the creative process.<br><br>Brown greatly admired her teacher, Elmer Bischoff, and his style of Bay Area figuration. But she also was attracted to the freedom found in abstraction as expressed by de Kooning, Picasso, and Matisse. Finding her own way, she used images of family, animals, water, romantic relationships, and self-portraits to explore the complexities of human nature, often hiding her rigorous self-reflection beneath a facade of painterly spontaneity. She had a lifelong interest in philosophy and religion, and much of her later work reflected universal themes and symbols.<br><br>Serious, full of energy and passion, Brown approached both her personal and her professional life with characteristic intensity. Married four times, she was a devoted mother, a competitive swimmer, and an outspoken opponent of the art world's growing commercialism. Many issues she dealt with early in her career anticipated similar concerns raised by the women's movement in the 1970s.<br><br>In 1990, while installing an obelisk she had created for the Eternal Heritage Museum in Puttaparthi, India, Joan Brown was instantly killed when a concrete turret fell on her. What lives on in her work is her fascination with the human condition and a determination to record its essence as reflected in her own life.</p><p><b>Karen Tsujimoto</b> is Senior Curator of Art at the Oakland Museum of California. She is the author of many exhibition catalogs, including a recent book on Peter Voulkos. <b>Jacquelynn Baas</b> is Director of the University of California Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. <b>Brenda Richardson</b> is former Deputy Director for Art and Curator of Modern Painting and Sculpture at The Baltimore Museum of Art.This rich volume, with outstanding color plates and illustrations, is at once an exhibition catalog and the first monograph devoted to the too short career of multitalented West Coast artist Joan Brown (1938-90). Brown's innovative and haunting symbolism is set down in her style of brilliant brushwork. Many of her paintings are autobiographical and to a degree reminiscent of Henri Rousseau and Frida Kahlo. Late in her career, Brown also created works of large-scale public sculpture, with iconography suggesting ancient Egypt, China, and India. Curators/art historians Tsujimoto and Baas lucidly demonstrate the freshness and power of Brown's vision. The volume ends with a long and detailed chronology, an exhibition history, and a bibliography.

Experiments are suggested to show various sizes and shades, and the concept of night is explained. Unfortunately, the brief, straightforward text is unimaginative. Otani's illustrations are flat and uninspired, depicting children with dot eyes and upturned curves for mouths.

Emma dives into the game of finding an admirer for her newest project, Harriet Smith. But Emma quickly realizes she&#x2019;s in over her head and that she might lose everything if she keeps playing. Beautifully presented for a modern teen audience, this is the must-have edition of Jane Austen&#x2019;s timeless romantic satire.</p></p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>The Best War Ever: America and World War II (The American Moment)</h2><p><p>Was it really such a "good war"? It was, if popular memory is to be trusted. We knew who the enemy was. We knew what we were fighting for. The war was good for the economy. It was liberating for women. It was a war of tanks and airplanes&#x2015;a cleaner war than World War I. Americans were united. Soldiers were proud. It was a time of prosperity, sound morality, and power.</p><p>But according to historian Michael Adams, our memory is distorted, and it has left us with a misleading&#x2015;even dangerous&#x2015;legacy. Challenging many of our common assumptions about the period, Adams argues that our experience of World War II was positive but also disturbing, creating problems that continue to plague us today.</p></p><p>Michael C. C.

Adams has a real gift for efficiently explaining complex historical problems.</p> (<i>Reviews in American History</i>)<br><br><p>Not only is this mythologizing bad history, says Adams, it is dangerous as well. Surrounding the war with an aura of nostalgia both fosters the delusion that war can cure our social ills and makes us strong again, and weakens confidence in our ability to act effectively in our own time.</p> (<i>Journal of Military History</i>)</p><h2>Arthur Harry Church:The Anatomy of Flowers</h2><p>Contains some of the finest botanical illustrations of the 20th century.</p><p>"Lush and sensual ... gorgeous" -- <i>House and Garden, October 2000</i><br><br>"Vivid sensuality ... informative ... revealing" -- <i>Country Living, September 2000</i></p><h2>Begin Here: The Forgotten Conditions of Teaching and Learning</h2><p>In this powerful, eloquent, and timely book, Jacques Barzun offers guidance for resolving the crisis in America's schools and colleges. Drawing on a lifetime of distinguished teaching, he issues a clear call to action for improving what goes on in America's classrooms. The result is an extraordinarily fresh, sensible, and practical program for better schools.<br><br>"It is difficult to imagine a more pungent, perceptive or eloquent commentary on contemporary American education than this collection of 15 pieces by Jacques Barzun."&#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Mr. Barzun's style is elegant, distinctive, philosophically consistent and much better-humored than that of many contemporary invective-hurlers."&#x2014;David Alexander, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Mechanized classroom methods and gimmicks are no substitute for the hard work of learning and the art of teaching. That straightforward message shines through these 15 essays and articles (most of them previously published) by eminent cultural historian Barzun ( The American University ) and edited by Philipson, director of the Univeristy of Chicago Press. The Columbia emeritus professor gives a flunking grade to multiple-choice tests, a "game of choosing the ready-made." He views the modern textbook ("its closest analog . . . a travel brochure") as typical of the way students are "fed in small mouthfuls," and he dismisses numerous curriculum fads as a sop to pupils' restlessness and short attention spans. Trenchant and challenging, this primer holds valuable lessons for educators at all levels. While our public schools are breeding grounds for an army of functional illiterates our universities are becoming assembly lines, observes Barzun. He calls for the abolition of "slave labor" whereby poorly paid graduate students teach undergrads, and for the elimination of the "publish-or-perish" syndrome that has led to reams of "junk research." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book gathers the various writings and comments of outspoken educator Barzun ( The American University , LJ 10/1/68), regarding the ailing American educational system. These freshly edited articles and essays offer a way out of a decaying system through teaching and learning in an old-fashioned way, rather than through the "radical innovations" of the so-called educational reformers. Some of the topics Barzun addresses include the inadequate ways in which reading is taught; the demeaning methods of teacher training; the counterfeit "social studies" programs which are the offshoot of combined geography and history curriculums; the benefits of reading the classics; and the effects of television on learning. In this collection one will find what schools and colleges should and could be if reforms are to "begin here." This is a practical, positive approach to developing better schools and colleges.<br><i>- Samuel T. Huang, Northern Illinois Univ.

(Because the WDM is rich in kernel and system services, the trick is often knowing how to use what's available rather than doing everything yourself.) The author presents a solid overview of the WDM architecture and breaks down the process of writing custom device drivers into manageable pieces, from the basics of loading device drivers to creating and processing I/O request packets. The book is very good at exposing kernel system calls, design principles, and programming techniques (such as managing synchronization and handling errors). There are also "nerd alerts" that point out extremely technical material.</p><p> This book shows you what you'll need to create WDM drivers that cooperate fully with Windows 2000 (and Windows 98). Features like Plug and Play (PnP), Windows power management, and the new Windows Management Instrumentation (WDM) standard get full attention here. There is plenty of sample code (plus a custom Visual C++ AppWizard that generates skeleton code for a default WDM driver) to get you started. Examples for working with the S5933 PCI chip set (and other simple hardware) let you see WDM drivers in action.</p><p> The process of writing device drivers certainly has changed from the early days of DOS.

In 1928, nineteen-year-old John Glassco escaped Montreal and his overbearing father for the wilder shores of Montparnasse. He remained there until his money ran out and his health collapsed, and he enjoyed every minute of his stay. Remarkable for their candor and humor, Glassco&#x2019;s memoirs have the daft logic of a wild but utterly absorbing adventure, a tale of desire set free that is only faintly shadowed by sadness at the inevitable passage of time.</p><p><b>John Glassco</b> (1909-1981) was born in Montreal and attended McGill, but moved to Paris before attaining his degree. Glassco won the Governor General&#x2019;s Award in 1971 for his <i>Selected Poems</i>.<br><br><b>Louis Begley</b> lives in New York City. His previous novels are <i>Wartime Lies, The Man Who Was Late, As Max Saw It, About Schimdt, Mistler&#x2019;s Exit, Schmidt Delivered</i>, and <i>Shipwreck</i>."It's wonderful to see John Glassco's charming <i>Memoirs of Montparnasse</i> getting the international recognition it deserves. Like its author -- whom I knew quite well in the 1960s -- the book is a loveable and eccentric rogue, fond of style and up to mischief. It never fails to entertain." -- Margaret Atwood<br><br>"<i>Memoirs of Montparnasse</i> is one of the most joyous books on youth -- the thrill and the gall and the adventure of it. It is also one of the best books on being in literary Paris in the 1920s." --Michael Ondaatje<br><br>"[<i>Memoirs of Montparnasse</i>] should be read and at last recognized as the most dramatic of the many narratives dealing with Paris in the 1920's." --<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"The title calls to mind a whole genre of books...But Glassco's book, published from a manuscript nearly forty years old, is fresher and truer to the moment than the others, as well as being more novelistic and, in a sense, legendary."--<i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"A very good book, perhaps a great book." --<i>The Washington Star</i><br><br>"The best book of prose by a Canadian that I've ever read." --<i>Montreal Gazette</i><br><br>"This is a delightful, on-the-spot report of the days when it was still possible to be very young, very hip and very happy all at the same time...this precious, witty document from a long-vanished younger generation has both the freshness and remoteness of some ornate space ship found intact in a forgotten tomb." --<i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Remembering Survival: Inside a Nazi Slave-Labor Camp</h2><p><p><strong>A remarkable story of survival for almost three hundred Jews who live to recount the brutalities of a Nazi work camp.</strong></p> In 1972 the Hamburg State Court acquitted Walter Becker, the German chief of police in the Polish city of Starachowice, of war crimes committed against Jews. Thirty years before, Becker had been responsible for liquidating the nearby Jewish ghetto, sending nearly 4,000 Jews to their deaths at Treblinka and 1,600 to slave-labor factories. The shocking acquittal, delivered despite the incriminating eyewitness testimony of survivors, drives this author&#x2019;s inquiry.<br><br> Drawing on the rich testimony of survivors of the Starachowice slave-labor camps, Christopher R. Browning examines the experiences and survival strategies of the Jewish prisoners and the policies and personnel of the Nazi guard. From the killings in the market square in 1942 through the succession of brutal camp regimes, there are stories of heroism, of corruption and retribution, of desperate choices forced on husbands and wives, parents and children. In the end, the ties of family and neighbor are the sinews of survival. 10 photos</p><p><strong>Christopher R. Browning</strong>, now retired from teaching, was the Frank Porter Graham Professor of History at the University of North Carolina and is the author of <em>Ordinary Men</em>, <em>Remembering Survival</em>, and other works of Holocaust history. He lives in Chapel Hill.In 1942 the liquidation of the Jewish-Polish ghetto of Wierzbnik sent 4,000 Jews to their deaths in Treblinka and enslaved another 1,600 at factory camps in the nearby town of Starachowice. Wierzbnik at its peak had 5,400 Jews, of whom 600 to 700 survived the war, and half of these left testimonies in memoirs or others forms. National Jewish Book Award&#x2013;winning historian Browning (<i>The Origins of the Final Solution</i>) bases his study primarily on survivor testimonies from the slave-labor camps at the Starachowice factory. Willi Althoff, the first commander of factory security whose killings of Jews were theatrically staged and who killed all Jews infected with typhus, was succeeded by pragmatist Kurt Baumgarten, who preferred keeping workers alive to increase factory production and line his pockets by extorting. Nuanced survivor accounts from live interviews, memoirs and archived accounts depicts some Ukrainian guards as sadistic anti-Semites while others were lenient, well-behaved, or corruptible. As the Soviets approached, the Germans deported the slaves to Auschwitz-Birkenau before retreating. Although too specialized for the casual reader, Browning's authoritative, lucid, and subtly analyzed microhistory of a relatively obscure area of Holocaust history will be of considerable value to scholars. 10 photos, maps. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Noah ventures deep into a world of blood-sucking leeches, chronic sleep deprivation, airline snafus, breakdowns, mudslides, floods, war zones, ecologic devastation, conservation triumphs, common and iconic species, and scores of passionate bird lovers around the globe. By pursuing the freest creatures on the planet, Noah gains a unique perspective on the world they share with us&#x2014;and offers a hopeful message that even as many birds face an uncertain future, more people than ever are working to protect them. <br>&nbsp;</p><p><p>NOAH STRYCKER is associate editor of <i>Birding</i> magazine and the author of several books.

Davis has a genius for bringing history to life, sorting out the players, the politics and the key events -- Harpers Ferry, Shiloh, Gettysburg, Emancipation, Reconstruction -- in a way that will enlighten even the most dedicated back-of-the-class napper. A brilliant crash course, this book vividly brings to life the people -- from Dred Scott to Abraham Lincoln -- and the everyday details that make up History with a capital H."What was the leading cause of death among Civil War soldiers? Why did Robert E. Lee resign from the U.S. Army? Which group was exempt from the Confederate draft? Whom did the Emancipation Proclamation emancipate? Was the Gettysburg Address truly written on the back of an envelope? Did General Sherman really say, "War is Hell?"<p>If you can't answer most of these questions, you're not alone. Millions of Americans, bored by dull textbooks, are in the dark about the most significant event in American history. Too many others thought they learned it all from Gone With the Wind.</p><p>Bestselling author Kenneth C. Davis sheds light on these and other questions about America's greatest conflict in this fascinating program, providing listeners with everything they "need to know" about the Civil War. With his deft wit and unconventional style, Davis sorts out the players, the politics, and the key events. Drawing on moving eyewitness accounts of the people who lived through the war, he brings listeners into the world of the ordinary men and women who made history -- the side of the story that textbooks never tell.</p><p>Don't Know Much About "RM" the Civil War explodes the myths and misconceptions about the war, its causes, and the men who fought on both sides. A brilliant crash course, it vividly brings to life Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Generals Lee and Grant, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe. It looks behind the battles and the tactics to the astounding human misery the war brought upon a divided nation, and includes a wealth of "hidden history," the lesser-known facts sure to fascinate even the most learned Civil War buff.</p></p><h2>Thermal Physics</h2><p><b>CONGRATULATIONS TO HERBERT KROEMER, 2000 NOBEL LAUREATE FOR PHYSICS</b><br> <br>For upper-division courses in thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, Kittel and Kroemer offers a modern approach to thermal physics that is based on the idea that all physical systems can be described in terms of their discrete quantum states, rather than drawing on 19th-century classical mechanics concepts.</p><p></p><h2>Word by Word: A Daily Spiritual Practice</h2><p><i>Beautifully written meditations on fifteen well-chosen words&nbsp;</i><br><br> In&nbsp;<i>What's in a Phrase?</i>&nbsp;&#x2014; winner of the 2015&nbsp;<i>Christianity Today</i>&nbsp;Book Award in Spirituality &#x2014; Marilyn McEntyre showed readers how brief scriptural phrases can evoke and invite.

Common words are color- coded red; blue denotes brief definitions embedded within more complete ones, along with etymology and pronunciation key. Words can also be accessed by their definitions (keywords section). Indexed by main entry, primary, and secondary root. The publisher&#39;s address is: PO Box 4498; Leesburg, VA 20177-8564. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p><i>English Vocabulary Quick Reference</i> takes an innovative approach to word roots. To start with, there's the "Primary Root Index"--a list of 260 essential word roots (including prefixes and suffixes), with definitions, language origin (Latin or Greek), and the dictionary page number where it's featured. It's a handy, easily accessible "a-" to "zyg-" list, but the unusual quality of the reference lies in its dictionary. Color-coded (red for common words such as are likely to appear on SATs, blue keywords to highlight succinct definitions), the dictionary presents more than 7,000 words based on those roots. From "abiogenesis" to "zygote," etymologies and definitions elucidate each word and encourage an understanding of the basic roots. This section is followed by a reverse dictionary of sorts--an alphabetical index of the keyword definitions. There's also an index of main entry words, and another index of 500 secondary roots that didn't make into the "Primary Root" list. Crutchfield's definitive book on word roots--geared toward educators, students of medicine, and students of English--is a superb classroom resource and a worthwhile home reference as well. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>This book was compiled by a team of professionals in the fields of English, computer science, medicine, biology, mineralogy, theology, and others.</p><h2>The Night Offices: Prayers for the Hours from Sunset to Sunrise</h2><p>Phyllis Tickle's inspirational trilogy <em>The Divine Hours</em>TM was the first major literary and liturgical reworking of the sixth-century Benedictine Rule of fixed-hour prayer--an age-old discipline of saying prayers at certain times of the day. This highly regarded trilogy has become one of America's best-loved and most frequently consulted manuals for observing this ancient form of Christian worship. <br><br>Now, in <em>The Night Offices</em>, Tickle offers the perfect complement to <em>The Divine Hours</em>TM, bringing together prayers, psalms, hymn texts, religious poetry and other readings not included in the original trilogy, covering the offices for the hours from late evening (Compline) to early morning (Prime). Fans of the <em>Divine Hours</em>TM will recognize Tickle's simple, elegant format, her use of a modern calendar rather than a liturgical one, and the single ribbon in the binding, to track one's progress through the year. As in the trilogy, Tickle makes primary use of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> and the writings of the Church Fathers, and she draws all the scriptural readings from the <em>Revised Standard Version</em>. The book includes a set of Matins, Lauds, and Prime specific to each day of the week and varied only by month. Thus, the Monday reading for January would be used every Monday in January, but Monday in February would have new offices for it. The cumulative total, being 84 Matins, 84 Lauds, and 84 Prime (252 offices), fits neatly into a single, nightstand edition, a small, compact book that can be comfortably held in the hand.<br><br>Easy to use, poetically rich, with a superb sampling of devotional works, <em>The Night Offices</em> will be welcomed by a broad readership, Christian and non-Christian alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>Phyllis Tickle</strong>, founding editor of the Religion Department at <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, is a highly respected authority on religion in America, frequently quoted in publications such as <em>USA Today, Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em> as well as on PBS and NPR.

Each chapter retains its rigorous examination and demonstration of an individual methodology, while continuing to be clear in structure and lucid in style. Reflecting changes in the way society consumes and creates its visual content, new features include&nbsp;a companion website featuring additional examples of digital and social media and moving images, pedagogical enhancements, additional chapters and expanded coverage on social and new media, and how to use visual materials for research and research presentation, and an expanded focus on how each method can be used in relation to a range of different visual materials. <br><br>A now classic text, the book appeals to undergraduates, graduates, researchers and academics in all subjects looking to understand and clearly grasp the complex debates and ideas in visual analysis and interpretation.<b> </b></p></p><p><p>My research interests lie broadly within the field of visual culture. I&#x2032;m interested in visuality as a kind of practice, done by human subjects in collaboration with different kinds of objects and technologies.<br><br>One long-term project, which resulted in a book from Ashgate Press in 2010, looked at family photos. I approached family snaps by thinking of them as objects embedded in a wide range of practices. I interviewed women with young children about their photos, and also looked at the politics and ethics of family snaps moving into more public arenas of display when the people they picture are the victims of violence. The book explores the different &#x2032;politics of sentiment&#x2032; in which family snaps participate in both their domestic spaces in the public space of the contemporary mass media.<br><br>Other work is extending my interest in subjectivities, space and visual practices by exploring experiences of designed urban spaces. I completed an ESRC-funded project on this theme with Dr Monica Degen at Brunel University in 2009, in which we compared how people experienced two rather different town centres: Milton Keynes and Bedford. Monica Degen, Clare Melhuish and I started a new ESRC-funded project in the autumn of 2011. &#x2032;Architectural atmospheres, branding and the social: the role of digital visualizing technologies in contemporary architectural practice&#x2032; was a two-year ethnographic study of how digital visualizing technologies are being used by architects in a number of architects&#x2032; studio in London.</p><p>I&#x2032;m also interested in more innovative ways to produce social science research, especially using visual materials.

In her Trelawny village she was one of ten children in a poor family; she was an only child in her relatives&#39; Westmoreland home of comparative wealth. Moving between households, she was pretty much being shifted between two extremes of a continuum based on race, colour and class in Jamaica. She now lives in Canada.She is the author of The Message is Change (on the 1972 General Elections in Jamaica), Talking of Trees (a collection of poems), a reference book, A-Z of Jamaican Heritage, andArrival of the snake woman in the Longman Caribbean Writers Series. Summer Lightning, winner of the Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prize for 1987, is Olive Senior&#39;s first collection of short stories.This is the most exciting collection of short stories to come out of the Caribbean for a very long time and it places Olive Senior in the front rank of short-fiction writers.

TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT</p><h2>Origins of Genius: Darwinian Perspectives on Creativity</h2><p>How can we account for the sudden appearance of such dazzling artists and scientists as Mozart, Shakespeare, Darwin, or Einstein? How can we define such genius? What conditions or personality traits seem to produce exceptionally creative people? Is the association between genius and madness really just a myth? These and many other questions are brilliantly illuminated in <em>The Origins of Genius</em>.<br> Dean Simonton convincingly argues that creativity can best be understood as a Darwinian process of variation and selection. The artist or scientist generates a wealth of ideas, and then subjects these ideas to aesthetic or scientific judgment, selecting only those that have the best chance to survive and reproduce. Indeed, the true test of genius is the ability to bequeath an impressive and influential body of work to future generations. Simonton draws on the latest research into creativity and explores such topics as the personality type of the genius, whether genius is genetic or produced by environment and education, the links between genius and mental illness (Darwin himself was emotionally and mentally unwell), the high incidence of childhood trauma, especially loss of a parent, amongst Nobel Prize winners, the importance of unconscious incubation in creative problem-solving, and much more. Simonton substantiates his theory by examining and quoting from the work of such eminent figures as Henri Poincare, W. H. Auden, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Charles Darwin, Niels Bohr, and many others.<br> For anyone intrigued by the spectacular feats of the human mind, <em>The Origins of Genius</em> offers a revolutionary new way of understanding the very nature of creativity.<br></p><p>What makes an Einstein happen? How is it that some kids grow up to be Nobel laureates while others, seemingly their equals, go on to undistinguished careers? Dean Simonton, professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis, has striven to understand this phenomenon for years and has compiled his insights and research in <i>Origins of Genius: Darwinian Perspectives on Creativity</i>. His evolutionary perspective sheds new light on an old topic, suggesting that the genius is able to generate a diverse range of ideas, recombine them, and choose the "fittest" with which to proceed. These faculties might have a wide range of origins, including both genetic and environmental, and Simonton tries to pinpoint them and their similarities with the etiology of mental illness. His writing style is humble and personable, yet as penetrating when discussing experimental results as it is humane when presenting examples of genius and madness at work. While defining such terms as <i>intelligence</i> and <i>creativity</i> are (and should be) daunting even to a thoughtful psychologist like Simonton, his use of the terms is precise enough to avoid mushy thinking yet wiggly enough to satisfy most critics. His deeply engaging writing coupled with the undeniable, almost urgent fascination that his subject holds makes <i>Origins of Genius</i> a rousing success by any standard. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><br><strong>Dean Simonton</strong> is Professor of Psychology at the University of California at Davis. The recipient of the Francis Galton Prize, he is the author of <em>Genius, Creativity, and Leadership, Scientific Genius, Why Presidents Succeed,</em> and other books.

Descriptions of magnificent larkspurs and burning nasturiums give way to those of cooling forest walks--and of clambering up a mud bank when the miller is not in view. Rainy days prompt a little philanthropy, until the sun returns the gardener to the refuge of her beloved plants. In her introduction, Deborah Kellaway writes: &#34;All of von Arnim&#39;s heroines are escapists. They escape from riches to the simple life, or from conventional home life into foreign travel...In her first two books &#34;[Elizabeth and Her German Garden&#34; and &#34;The Solitary Summer],&#34; the escape is simply into the garden...And it is her capacity to present her joy in that place that made the books bestsellers. Here readers are escaping, with her, into happiness.&#34;Elizabeth von Arnim was born in 1866 in Sydney, Australia, and brought up in England.

T. Wright's magisterial series, Christian Origins and the Question of God, is destined to become the standard reference point on the subject for all serious students of the Bible and theology. The mature summation of a lifetime's study, this landmark book pays a rich tribute to the breadth and depth of the apostle's vision, and offers an unparalleled wealth of detailed insights into his life, times, and enduring impact.<p>Wright carefully explores the whole context of Paul's thought and activity&#x2014; Jewish, Greek and Roman, cultural, philosophical, religious, and imperial&#x2014; and shows how the apostle's worldview and theology enabled him to engage with the many-sided complexities of first-century life that his churches were facing. Wright also provides close and illuminating readings of the letters and other primary sources, along with critical insights into the major twists and turns of exegetical and theological debate in the vast secondary literature. The result is a rounded and profoundly compelling account of the man who became the world's first, and greatest, Christian theologian.</p></p><p>N. T. Wright is the former Bishop of Durham in the Church of England and one of the world&#39;s leading Bible scholars. He is now Research Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of St. Andrews and is a regular broadcaster on radio and television. He is the author of over sixty books, including The New Testament and the People of God (1992), Jesus and the Victory of God (1996), The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003), Pauline Perspectives (2013), and Paul and His Recent Interpreters (2013), all published by Fortress Press."N. T. Wright's long-awaited full-length study of St. Paul will not in any way disappoint. From the very first sentence, it holds the attention, arguing a strong, persuasive, coherent, and fresh case supported by immense scholarship and comprehensive theological intelligence. It is a worthy successor to his earlier magisterial studies, laying out again very plainly the ways in which the faith of the New Testament is focused on God's purpose to re-create, through the fact of Jesus crucified and risen, our entire understanding of authority and social identity." --Rowan Williams, Magdalene College, Cambridge<br><br>"Only once in every other generation or so does a project approaching the size, scope, and significance of Paul and the Faithfulness of God appear. Paul's world, worldview, controlling stories, and theology spring to life through N. T. Wright's brilliant scholarship and spirited writing. Arguing for narrative and theological coherence in Paul's thought, Wright seeks to overcome numerous dichotomies that have characterized recent Pauline scholarship. Readers will be richly rewarded and challenged at every turn&#x2014;even when they do not fully agree. Each chapter reveals something profound about the surprising faithfulness of the God freshly revealed in Jesus the Messiah and conveyed to Paul's communities, and to us, by the Spirit." --Michael J. Gorman, St. Mary's Seminary &amp; University, Baltimore, Maryland<br><br>"Breath-taking, mind-expanding, ground-breaking, and more&#x2014;it is easy to run out of adjectives to describe what N. T. Wright has already accomplished in his multi-volume account of New Testament history and theology. This fourth volume in the series is likewise a game-changer, above all for its adventurous presentation of Paul's &#x2018;mindsetrsquo; and theology, so thoroughly contextualized at the confluence of the apostle's Jewish, Roman, and Greek worlds. This is Wright at his best&#x2014;part historian, part exegete, part theologian, part pedagogue." --Joel B.

The twelve chapters, written by seven distinguished scholars, cover tragedy as an institution in the civic life of ancient Athens, a range of approaches to the surviving plays, and changing patterns of reception, adaptation and performance from antiquity to the present.</p><p>"No dry handbook purveying conventional wisdom with an air of authority, this volume is the product of a group of scholars doing some of the most exciting work on Greek tragedy. They contribute essays on such subjects as the civic context of Athenian theater, Dionysus, the composition of the audience, pictorial representations of tragedy, the sociology of tragedy (gender, class), tragic language, and the construction of the plot, concluding with chapters on modern adaptations and performances and recent critical approaches. One may consult the volume on particular topics or read it cover to cover: the essays are lively and the treatments thorough without suppressing individual styles and views....Highly recommended for all classics collections." D. Konstan, Choice<br><br>"It is not merely ironic, but a welcome sign of growing theoretical sophistication among classicists, that the book should demonstrate so convincingly the benefits - indeed, the necessity - of studying Greek tragedy from more than merely literary perspectives. The general quality of the essays is remarkably high: they address topics of central interest with both methodological awareness and (where appropriate) command of relevant textual detail. In sum, I believe that serious students of Greek tragedy will find this to be a boon Companion indeed, and will return to their primary texts with excitement and gratitude for a heightened appreciation of tragedy's complex cultural significance."

The family moved to London in 1823, but their fortunes were severely impaired. Dickens was sent to work in a blacking-warehouse when his father was imprisoned for debt. Both experiences deeply affected the future novelist. In 1833 he began contributing stories to newspapers and magazines, and in 1836 started the serial publication of Pickwick Papers. Thereafter, Dickens published his major novels over the course of the next twenty years, from Nicholas Nickleby to Little Dorrit. He also edited the journals Household Words and All the Year Round. Dickens died in June 1870.</p><h2>William Shakespeare: A Documentary Life</h2><p>This beautiful new edition of Shakespeare's complete works--"The Oxford Shakespeare"--is the product of eight years of full-time research by a team of British and American scholars and represents the most thorough examination ever undertaken of the nature and authority of the early documents.<br> The edition abounds in unique features. It is the first volume to provide edited texts of <em>King Lear</em> both as Shakespeare originally wrote it and as it was revised for performance somes years later.

Lila Abu-Lughod boldly challenges this conclusion. An anthropologist who has been writing about Arab women for thirty years, she delves into the predicaments of Muslim women today, questioning whether generalizations about Islamic culture can explain the hardships these women face and asking what motivates particular individuals and institutions to promote their rights.</p><p>In recent years Abu-Lughod has struggled to reconcile the popular image of women victimized by Islam with the complex women she has known through her research in various communities in the Muslim world. Here, she renders that divide vivid by presenting detailed vignettes of the lives of ordinary Muslim women, and showing that the problem of gender inequality cannot be laid at the feet of religion alone. Poverty and authoritarianism&#x2015;conditions not unique to the Islamic world, and produced out of global interconnections that implicate the West&#x2015;are often more decisive. The standard Western vocabulary of oppression, choice, and freedom is too blunt to describe these women's lives.</p><p><i>Do Muslim Women Need Saving? </i>is an indictment of a mindset that has justified all manner of foreign interference, including military invasion, in the name of rescuing women from Islam&#x2015;as well as a moving portrait of women's actual experiences, and of the contingencies with which they live.</p></p><p>Lila Abu-Lughod is the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science at Columbia University, where she teaches anthropology and women&#39;s studies.&#x201c;[A] beautiful book... It is a riveting account by an academic who has spent many years observing women in the Middle East and the West, and adeptly wears several hats as an anthropologist and professor in women&#x2019;s studies. Abu-Lughod is a great listener and a sharp observer of everyday life. She understands the struggles, joys and jealousies of Middle Eastern women and has an ear for the stories that do not make headlines. Refusing to treat Muslim women as a category, she focuses on nuances and complexities. Where others see an undifferentiated mass of individuals, she sees real women with real stories... There are Islams, just like there are Judaisms, Christianities and Hinduisms. We need to make the word plural to understand the wide variety of practices and power relations. And Lila Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s <i>Do Muslim Women Need Saving?</i> does precisely that with its captivating approach.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elif Shafak</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Every page contains a fresh riposte to easy cultural or religious explanations for women&#x2019;s oppression... <i>Do Muslim Women Need Saving?</i> is the result of many years&#x2019; rumination over contemporary feminist debates in the developing world... In this volatile debate Lila Abu-Lughod frequently reminds her readers that she writes &#x2018;as an anthropologist.&#x2019; In keeping with this role, she offers no simple remedy for female suffering abroad; nor does she condone the shrug that dismisses distant injustices as &#x2018;just their culture.&#x2019; Instead, she offers an injunction to look and listen carefully for suffering at home as well as overseas, and to examine &#x2018;our own responsibilities for the situations in which others in distant places find themselves.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nabeelah Jaffer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Saving Muslim women is now a global undertaking in which the participants are both Muslim and non-Muslim. Lila Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s book is a critical reflection on this mushrooming industry, and its representatives, representations and bureaucracy... Abu-Lughod succeeds in...exposing several stubbornly persistent myths. She critically assesses the vast number of sensational representations of women, written by Muslims and others, about the general repression in a so-called IslamLand. She follows the trail of global feminism in the extensive bureaucracy, institutions and non-governmental organizations that have emerged since the 1990s, all claiming to save Muslim women... Her focus on analyzing how individual Muslim women experience freedom, rights and constraints brings a much-needed perspective... She offers a panoramic view of women&#x2019;s multiple experiences in their own contexts, thereby dismissing sweeping generalizations about these women being a homogeneous oppressed mass. She urges us to look at contexts shaped by global politics, international capital and modern state institutions that all contribute to changing landscapes of family and community. Abu-Lughod reminds us that rights may be universal but above all they are projects bounded by political contexts, institutions and language... This book is destined to unsettle the convictions of those concerned with saving Muslim women. Many will find it shocking for its uncompromising critique of recent moral crusades, while careful readers will doubtless find in it enough ammunition to deconstruct projects that may seem worth pursuing, but ultimately are not as focused on improving women&#x2019;s lives in faraway places as they first appear. Abu-Lughod dissolves geographical boundaries, exposes the limits of global morality, and deconstructs the international power context that allows Muslim women to remain that distant voiceless other, awaiting intervention. It invites us to think not only about dominant representations of Muslim women in images and words, but also about our own engagement with the other, which has always taken place in an unequal context.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Madawi Al-Rasheed</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There is an ethical dimension to [Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s] attention to the particularities and complexities of difference between women of different countries, social backgrounds and cultures, and even within cultures she&#x2019;s always attuned to the differences brought about by class and economic background...Through her in-depth demolition of the new moral crusades brought on by the genre of &#x2018;gendered Orientalism&#x2019; in the pulp nonfiction of books by &#x2018;insiders,&#x2019; i.e., Muslim women who threw off their shackles or who tore off their veils and ran away from their oppressive Muslim homes in order to live the precise kind of life lived by a certain class of Western woman in urban areas, Abu-Lughod zeroes in on the treacherous hypocrisy of the seemingly well-read and well-educated class of progressive Westerners.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Subashini Navaratnam</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Some of the most rewarding material in <i>Do Muslim Women Need Saving?</i> examines the obsession with constraint that counterposes perceptions of Muslim women to Enlightenment ideals of freedom and autonomy, connected to theoretical work by Wendy Brown, Judith Butler, and Saba Mahmood... While she is hardly alone in critiquing the flattened stereotype of the abject Muslim woman, Abu-Lughod brings refreshing new observations to this well-trodden ground... Abu-Lughod provocatively suggests that American feminism shares with older imperial agendas the political imperative to see Muslim women as particularly oppressed... This book is a great service to those of us who have long wanted for a resource we can recommend to explain why Muslim women do not need saving. Persuasive, generous, and insightful, Abu-Lughod asks us to bring our careful analysis, critical self-reflection, and constant recognition of our common but also differently expressed humanity to the table.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Leti Volpp</b><b>, </b><b><i>Public Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s principal strengths lie in skillfully deconstructing the symbolic significance of a range of high profile &#x2018;moral crusades&#x2019; involving Muslim women which have captured the global imagination. Abu-Lughod highlights how the most basic conditions of these women&#x2019;s lives are set by political forces that are often national or even international in origin even if they are local in effect...She argues that concepts such as &#x2018;oppression,&#x2019; &#x2018;choice,&#x2019; and &#x2018;freedom&#x2019; are blunt instruments for capturing the dynamics and quality of Muslim women&#x2019;s lives in these places. In addition to revealing such characterizations as overly simplistic, Abu-Lughod also analyses the politics and the ethics of the international circulation of discourses about &#x2018;the oppressed Muslim woman.&#x2019; She shows, for example, how debates on the veil and discussions of honor crimes are deployed as 21st century political projects. She writes passionately about the salacious and voyeuristic way in which such crimes are recorded, pointedly asking why knowing about the &#x2018;culture&#x2019; has been seen as more important than exploring the story of the development of repressive regimes in the region. Equally, she highlights how in the West such discourses are unashamedly linked to xenophobic immigration policies. She warns of the risks entailed in such polarizing &#x2018;savior&#x2019; discourses whereby feminism and even secularism are only seen as Western concepts...This book represents a necessary if uncomfortable intervention for those who may uncritically engage in the diverse range of clarion calls to save Muslim women...Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s book provides a richly evidenced and easy to read deconstruction of simplistic culturalist explanations of any phenomena which pertain to Muslim women in all their diversity. As with other postcolonial feminists such as Mohanty and Narayan her approach represents a useful analytical tool to explore contemporary controversies about the experiences of Muslim and other Other women in all their complexity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Naaz Rashid</b><b>, </b><b><i>LSE Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sharply observed take on the Western impulse to save oppressed Muslim women and the wider political, legal and cultural issues at stake.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Marc Lynch</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post blog</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the book&#x2019;s great accomplishments is to present readers with concrete examples of women who explain their actions and justify their choices, instead of caricatured victims to be pitied and saved by enlightened others.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joan W. Scott</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Middle East Women&#x2019;s Studies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In accessible, lucid prose, Abu-Lughod explains how sensationalized memoirs, or &#x2018;pulp nonfiction,&#x2019; have perpetuated stereotypes and made Muslim women a symbol of an alien culture. The author dispassionately points out the hypocrisy of colonial feminism, and how more often than not, there is a clear political agenda behind the liberation of the &#x2018;women of cover&#x2019; and how the role of the U.S. is often overlooked. The women presented here see their Islamic faith as a source of strength to fight injustice, not the cause of it. They&#x2019;re not asking to be rescued from their religion, the author contends, but from the discriminatory legal system, poverty, outdated patriarchal family traditions, and border controls that continue to inhibit their freedom. While offering no easy solution, the author recommends observation over moral crusades, stating: &#x2018;Anyone seriously interested in Muslim women&#x2019;s rights must follow them as they move.&#x2019; This book is an excellent place to begin.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Tracing connections from human rights groups and international feminist NGOs, to philosophy and anthropology, to best-selling memoirs of Muslim women and titillating pulp fiction accounts of Muslim women&#x2019;s suffering, Abu-Lughod argues that the West&#x2019;s perception of Muslim women as creatures in need of rescue is shaped by a confluence of powerful forces. Incisively argued and often sharply critical, Abu-Lughod&#x2019;s book&#x2015;which will surely spark debate&#x2015;is essential reading for anyone interested in women&#x2019;s rights in the Muslim world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Leila Ahmed, author of <i>A Quiet Revolution: The Veil&#x2019;s Resurgence from the Middle East to America</i></b></p><h2>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Geographical Dictionary</h2><p>&#34;A comprehensive source of geographical, economic, historical, and political information.

The Panic of 1857 closed every bank in New York City, ruined thousands of businesses, and caused widespread unemployment among industrial workers. The Mormons in Utah Territory threatened rebellion when federal troops approached with a non-Mormon governor to replace Brigham Young. The Supreme Court outraged northern Republicans and abolitionists with the Dred Scott decision ("a breathtaking example of judicial activism"). And when a proslavery minority in Kansas Territory tried to foist a proslavery constitution on a large antislavery majority, President Buchanan reneged on a crucial commitment and supported the minority, a disastrous miscalculation which ultimately split the Democratic party in two.<br> In <em>America in 1857</em>, eminent American historian Kenneth Stampp offers a sweeping narrative of this eventful year, covering all the major crises while providing readers with a vivid portrait of America at mid-century. Stampp gives us a fascinating account of the attempt by William Walker and his band of filibusters to conquer Nicaragua and make it a slave state, of crime and corruption, and of street riots by urban gangs such as New York's Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys and Baltimore's Plug Uglies and Blood Tubs. But the focus continually returns to Kansas. He examines the outrageous political frauds perpetrated by proslavery Kansans, Buchanan's calamitous response and Stephen Douglas's break with the President (a rare event in American politics, a major party leader repudiating the president he helped elect), and the whirl of congressional votes and dramatic debates that led to a settlement humiliating to Buchanan--and devastating to the Democrats.<br> 1857 marked a turning point, at which sectional conflict spun out of control and the country moved rapidly toward the final violent resolution in the Civil War. Stampp's intensely focused look at this pivotal year illuminates the forces at work and the mood of the nation as it plummeted toward disaster.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kenneth M.

After a brief career in law, Buchan simultaneously began writing and his political and diplomatic career, serving as a private secretary to the colonial administrator of various colonies in Southern Africa, and eventually wrote propaganda for the British war effort in First World War. Once back in civilian life, Buchan was elected Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities, but spent most of his time on his writing career.

Set at the time of the 1905 Revolution and centring on episodes in the lives of a landowner and his self-educated peasant brother, the book follows characters sunk so far below the average of intelligence as to be scarcely human. A triumph of bitter realism, Bunin&#x2019;s cruel, lyrical prose reveals the pettiness, violence and ignorance of life on the land, foreshadowing the turbulences of Russia in the twentieth century.</p><p>Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin (1870-1953) was the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Imagine music, movies, books, and paintings of the highest quality. Imagine art that permeates society, challenging conventional thinking and standard morals to their core. Imagine that it is all created by Christians! This is the bold vision of Steve Turner, who has worked among a wide variety of artists for decades. He believes Christians should confront society and the church using art&#39;s powerful impact. Art can faithfully chronicle the lives of ordinary people and express the transcendence of God. And Christians should be involved in every level of the art world and in every medium. In this revised and expanded edition of a contemporary classic, Turner builds a compelling case for Christians in the arts. If Jesus is Lord of all of life and creation, then art is part of his cultural mandate. It can and should be a way of expressing faith through creatively, beautifully, and truthfully arranged words, sounds, and sights. Now includes study questions for individual reflection or group discussion.</p><p>Steve Turner is a journalist and poet living in London, England. His many books include <em>Beatles '66, The Man Called Cash, Conversations with Eric Clapton, U2: Rattle and Hum, Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, A Hard Day's Write</em>, and <em>Popcultured</em>."What I found so compelling about the first edition of <em>Imagine</em> was not simply that Steve Turner was calling the church to reimagine its approach toward the arts and its artists. After all, a growing chorus of voices was saying much the same and continues to do so today. Instead, what I found most compelling was that Turner was calling artists to take up their vocation in a way that moved them out into the world while remaining tethered to the very community of faith that gave birth to them in the first place. In this revised edition, Turner doubles down on this clarion call, reminding us all that, perhaps now more than ever, the church desperately needs its artists to be artists. But so too do artists need the church." (Kutter Callaway, assistant professor of theology and culture, Fuller Theological Seminary, author of Scoring Transcendence and Watching TV Religiously)<br><br>"The brevity and clarity of this beautiful little book belie the breadth and richness of its artistic, theological, and biblical content. Steve Turner's incisive exegesis of the nexus between popular arts and Christianity is unmatched, for he has equally inhabited these worlds his entire career. He is not afraid to tell the truth. A constant required text for one of our courses, an alumnus shared years ago how it changed his view of himself as an artist, and a new alumnus says he reads it over and over. Personally, I discovered within its pages the insight inspiring my own doctoral thesis. The revised version's addition of quotes you've always wanted to find, questions you've needed to ask, and examples of current artists seriously increases its value. It is simply the the most compelling, lucid articulation of what it is to be a Christian in the arts that I've found." (Rebecca Ver Straten-McSparran, director, L.A. Film Studies Center)<br><br>"This book helps bridge the gap from when God said, 'Let there be. . .' to what we, his creation, were designed to create and enjoy. It should be read by anyone who appreciates or is influenced by art and media in all of its forms&#x2015;that is, everyone. When I am asked by either the curious or the caustic what a Christian is doing working in Hollywood, I just want to hand them this book and say, 'Imagine this.'" (Dean Batali, TV writer, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and That '70s Show)<br><br>"<em>Can you sing songs shaped by the truest truths of the universe in language the whole world can understand?</em> For years I have been asking this question, and I first did so standing beside Steve Turner at the Art House in Nashville, answering questions from a roomful of young musicians. In and through his own art, he has lived into that question with unusual integrity, which is why for most of my life I have chosen to listen to him, learning to see the world through his words. A remarkably gifted poet, sometimes making us laugh and sometimes cry, he is an artist who writes about art with an honesty that is rare. <em>Imagine</em> is for everyone who longs for good faith and good art to be seamless&#x2015;as they could be, as they should be." (Steven Garber, The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation Culture, author of Visions of Vocation)<br><br>"Culture, calling, and the arts. This trio of concerns has perplexed and troubled faithful Christians in the West for many centuries. But in recent decades, a small yet potent art and faith movement has been gaining force. In some Christian circles, the art is getting better and the understanding of culture more nuanced. Steve Turner was an early and thoughtful voice in this movement, and the reissue of his book <em>Imagine</em> is a solid point of beginning for those eager both to understand its contours and then find their way forward in it." (Cameron J. Anderson, artist, executive director of CIVA (Christians in the Visual Arts), author of The Faithful Artist)<br><br>"Put simply, it's the best of its kind. Like in 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears,' <em>Imagine</em> is neither too long nor too heavy, neither too short nor too light. It's just right: an accessible, smart, farsighted, and generous introduction to the basic questions a Christian may ask as he or she participates in the arts. It's the one book I gave all artists when I was a pastor. It's still the one book." (W. David O. Taylor, Fuller Theological Seminary, editor, For the Beauty of the Church: Casting a Vision for the Arts)<br><br>"Steve Turner is one of the most gifted writers of our time. I first encountered him through his poetry, with its deceptively simple and arresting lines, its illuminating commentary on all of life. Then I met Turner the rock 'n' roll historian. <em>Hungry for Heaven</em> is easily the best overview of this powerful soundtrack. Here, Steve's investigations extend to a host of individual musicians, bands, and genres. This volume, appropriately named <em>Imagine</em>, is a beautifully crafted defense of worldview thinking. It interacts with the arts but reaches far wider. Required reading for anyone wishing to make sense of the world. On all accounts, the book is an absolute treasure." (William Edgar, professor of apologetics, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia)<br><br>"This affirming book says all the things I'd like my friends to understand about me as an artist. At the same time it challenged me to be more actively engaged with our culture through artmaking infused with the gospel." (Timothy R. Botts, artist and designer)<br><br>"Drawing on years of experience, a first-rate poet sketches a Christian vision for the arts and artists in our time. With disarming directness he calls Christians out of their ecclesiastical ghettos to live that vision out. Readable, entertaining, and bold." (Jeremy Begbie, author of Voicing Creation's Praise: Towards a Theology of the Arts)<br><br>"Turner, in this well-rounded and thoroughly biblical book, issues a compelling invitation to everyone in the creative community to move redemptively, as salt and light, into the world of the arts precisely for Christ's sake." (Michael Card, recording artist, author of Scribbling in the Sand: Christ and Creativity)</p><h2>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation (Second Edition)</h2><p><p><b></b> Most books on operating systems deal with theory while ignoring practice.

That has become quite popular, very large, and complicated. MINIX, on the other hand, has remained small and suitable for instruction and example. The book has been revised to include updates in MINIX, which started out as a v 7 unix clone for a floppy-disk only 8088. It is now aimed at 386, 486, and pentium machines and is based on the international posix standard instead of on v7.

Here are nineteen stories that explore her signature themes: wounded adolescence, loneliness in marriage, and the tragicomedy of life in the South. Here too are &#34;The Member of the Wedding&#34; and &#34;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,&#34; novellas that Tennessee Williams judged to be &#34;assuredly among the masterpieces of our language.&#34; (A Mariner Reissue)</p><p>Carson McCullers (1917-1967) was the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>, <i>The Member of the Wedding</i>, <i>Reflections in a Golden Eye</i>, and <i>Clock Without Hands</i>. Born in Columbus, Georgia, on February 19, 1917, she became a promising pianist and enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York when she was seventeen, but lacking money for tuition, she never attended classes. Instead she studied writing at Columbia University, which ultimately led to <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i>, the novel that made her an overnight literary sensation. On September 29, 1967, at age fifty, she died in Nyack, New York, where she is buried.This work collects for the first time all 19 of McCullers's stories from a 1951 edition and from The Mortgaged Heart (1971). Her most critically acclaimed novels round out the reader, while the author's biographer Virginia Carr provides a lucid, thoughtful introduction. McCullers patented the Southern gothic genre that embraces grotesque, morbid characters with such pervading themes as unrequited love and wounded adolescence. Largely set in the South and richly autobiographical, her writings have endured because of their great power and originality. Sure to appeal to the general reader, the volume will also satisfy scholars with its broad look at McCullers's oeuvre. Edward C.

It is a masterpiece of the art of translation of which the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> said: "It has the rare merit of reading as though it were an English original." Lehrmann was able to capture the essence of Cocteau's strange, necromantic imagination and to bring fully to life in English his story of a brother and sister, orphaned in adolescence, who build themselves a private world out of one shared room and their own unbridled fantasies.

They cover Locke&#39;s theory of ideas, his philosophies of body, mind, language, and religion, his theory of knowledge, his ethics, and his political philosophy. There are also chapters on Locke&#39;s life and subsequent influence. New readers and nonspecialists will find this the most convenient, accessible guide to Locke currently available.</p><p>"No one ever had common sense before John Locke," said Bertrand Russell, chauvinistically adding, "and no one but Englishmen have ever had it since." Commonsensical or not, Locke produced two masterpieces of profound importance: <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i> and <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>. In <i>The Cambridge Companion to Locke</i>, 10 eminent Locke scholars systematically survey his philosophy, amply demonstrating (as editor Vere Chappell remarks) "the vitality and quality of current Locke scholarship." No student of Locke will want to ignore it.<p> The first essay discusses Locke's life and times; the last essay discusses his far-reaching influence. In between, fully half of the essays are devoted to topics discussed in Locke's <i>Essay</i>. Locke's theory of ideas is expounded by Chappell, who hints at its importance by remarking that the word <i>idea</i> is the most frequently used noun in the <i>Essay</i>. It is puzzling that there is no complete essay here on the renowned distinction between primary and secondary qualities; fortunately, the concept is clearly explained in Edwin McCann's excellent essay on Locke's philosophy of body. Jonathan Bennett struggles valiantly to squeeze as much of Locke's philosophy of mind as he can into one essay; the result is useful if cramped. Other aspects of Locke's thought are not neglected; in particular, his moral thought and political theory receive careful treatment from J.B. Schneewind and the late Richard Ashcraft. His philosophy of religion is discussed by Nicholas Wolterstorff, who continues his discussion in his monograph <i>John Locke and the Ethics of Belief</i>. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>The essays in this volume provide a systematic survey of Locke&#39;s philosophy as revealed in the most recent scholarship.

First published in 1971 in a typewritten edition, then finally printed in book form in 1989, &#34;I Served the King of England&#34; is &#34;an extraordinary and subtly tragicomic novel&#34; (&#34;The New York Times&#34;), telling the tale of Ditie, a hugely ambitious but simple waiter in a deluxe Prague hotel in the years before World War II. Ditie is called upon to serve not the King of England, but Haile Selassie. It is one of the great moments in his life. Eventually, he falls in love with a Nazi woman athlete as the Germans are invading Czechoslovakia. After the war, through the sale of valuable stamps confiscated from the Jews, he reaches the heights of his ambition, building a hotel.

Yet its history was one that for a long time proved impossible to write.<br><br> In <i>The Soviet Century</i>, Moshe Lewin follows this history in all its complexity, guiding us through the inner workings of a system which is still barely understood. In the process he overturns widely held beliefs about the USSR&#x2019;s leaders, the State-Party system and the powerful Soviet bureaucracy.<br><br> Departing from a simple linear history, <i>The Soviet Century</i> traces all the continuities and ruptures that led from the founding revolution of October 1917 to the final collapse of the late 1980s and early 1990s, passing through the Stalinist dictatorship, the impossible reforms of the Khrushchev years and the glasnost and perestroika policies of Gorbachev.</p><p><b>Moshe Lewin</b> was a hugely respected historian of the Soviet Union. Professor of Soviet Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, his books include <i>Stalinism and Nazism: Dictatorships in Comparison </i>and <i>The Making of the Soviet System: Essays in the Social History of Interwar Russia.</i>&#x201c;Probably no other Western historian of the USSR combines Moshe Lewin&#x2019;s personal experience of living with Russians from Stalin&#x2019;s day&#x2014;as a young wartime soldier&#x2014;to the post-communist era, with so profound a familiarity with the archives and the literature of the Soviet era.

It is that dual perspective that has guided his half-century-long publishing career and that makes this compact yet expansive professional memoir such a lively, illuminating read for anyone curious how current trade publishing--basically popular general-interest fiction and nonfiction--became obsessed with a narrow pool of quickie bestsellers to the neglect of the far greater mass of slow-burners (known in the biz as "midlist") or of the perennial sellers from years past ("backlist"). But, Epstein follows up with great enthusiasm, the time is not long before the book biz will morph into a new cyberversion of the quirky, intimate "cottage industry" that it was in its precorporate era.<p> It was in that era that Epstein came of age as a publisher, first at Doubleday in the 1950s, where he founded the successful Anchor Books, the first line of high-quality paperback reissues of classics. The four succeeding decades he spent at Random House, which in that time grew from a family-type shop into one of the largest and most profitable trade publishing houses in the U.S. (currently owned by the German media titan Bertelsmann). Epstein's chronicle of New York publishing jumps around nimbly in time--at one point, all the way back to the 19th century--but it is in recounting the heady, culturally efflorescent postwar years that he waxes most tender, regaling us with vignettes of Ralph Ellison, Mary McCarthy, John O'Hara, Frank O'Hara, W.H. Auden, Chester Kallman, and John Ashbery. Throughout, his entrepreneurial spirit in the service of good books is evident--first in the founding (along with, among others, his wife Barbara) of the still-extant <i>New York Review of Books</i>, then in the thorny 30-year process of publishing the classics imprint Library of America, and in the launching of <i>The Reader's Catalog</i>, a mail-order service from which customers could choose from what nearly every book on the planet in print--and which deservedly has been called the hard-copy precursor to the very site you're browsing right now. </p><p> Like <i>The Business of Books</i>, the recent memoir from former Pantheon Books head Andre Schiffrin (Epstein's longtime colleague within Random House), Epstein's book decries the extent to which superstores like Barnes &amp; Noble have forced the high-stakes (and seldom fruitful) corporatization of book publishing. But Epstein prefers to look past the current situation to an imminent day when writers will sell directly to readers over the Internet, a format that will still demand the services of editors, publicists, and marketers but will cut out the costly middlemen of publishing companies, distributors, and superstores (though not small booksellers, he assures us, which nurture bonds among booklovers that even the Web can't sever). Yes, there's money to be made in trade books, Epstein asserts, but not necessarily overnight. And in this brisk, affable, and forward-looking volume, Epstein's own broad-ranging experience in the book biz seems to bear out his recurring theme: do it for love, not money, and the money (if not necessarily the millions) will eventually follow. --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p><b>Jason Epstein</b>, former editorial director of Random House, was the first recipient of the National Book Award for Distinguished Service to American Letters.</p><h2>Robert Ryman</h2><p><b>A comprehensive study highlighting the interplay of context and meaning in Robert Ryman&#x2019;s work</b><br><br> This remarkable volume, featuring new photography and original essays by a formidable array of scholars and curators, is the most expansive and thorough investigation of the work of American painter Robert Ryman in over two decades.&nbsp; Arguing that the relationships between his paintings are key to understanding his diverse output, the book offers more faithful reproductions and subtler details of the paintings than have previously been available, and attends closely to the artist&#x2019;s own strategies of display.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ryman&#x2019;s paintings are readily identified by their predominantly achromatic surfaces, but his exploration of the values and effects of white was never limited to paint.

The texts featured here reflect on the importance of Ryman&#x2019;s practice to contemporary art: Robert Storr, curator of Ryman&#x2019;s 1993 retrospective, places the painter in historical context while Courtney J.

Including stories from the 1970s to the present day, the collection seeks to expand the conversation about feminism while engaging the reader in a wealth of imaginative ideas. From the literary heft of Angela Carter to the searing power of Octavia Butler, <i>Sisters of the Revolution</i> gathers daring examples of speculative fiction&#x2019;s engagement with feminism. Dark, satirical stories such as Eileen Gunn&#x2019;s &#x201c;Stable Strategies for Middle Management&#x201d; and the disturbing horror of James Tiptree Jr.&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Screwfly Solution&#x201d; reveal the charged intensity at work in the field. Including new, emerging voices such as Nnedi Okorafor and featuring international contributions from Angelica Gorodischer and many more, this collection seeks to expand the ideas of both contemporary fiction and feminism to new fronts. Moving from the fantastic to the futuristic, subtle to surreal, these stories will provoke thoughts and emotions about feminism like no other book available today. Other contributors include Anne Richter, Carol Emshwiller, Eleanor Arnason, Hiromi Goto, Joanna Russ, Karin Tidbeck, Kelley Eskridge, Kelly Barnhill, Kit Reed, L.

It can also be used by students who have completed a basic calculus course. Our aim is to present probability in a natural way: through interesting and instructive examples and exercises that motivate the theory, definitions, theorems, and methodology. Examples and exercises have been carefully designed to arouse curiosity and hence encourage the students to delve into the theory with enthusiasm. </p> <p> Authors are usually faced with two opposing impulses. One is a tendency to put too much into the book, because <i>everything</i> is important and <i>everything</i> has to be said the author's way! On the other hand, authors must also keep in mind a clear definition of the focus, the level, and the audience for the book, thereby choosing carefully what should be "in" and what "out." Hopefully, this book is an acceptable resolution of the tension generated by these opposing forces. </p> <p> Instructors should enjoy the versatility of this text. They can choose their favorite problems and exercises from a collection of 1558 and, if necessary, omit some sections and/or theorems to teach at an appropriate level. </p> <p> Exercises for most sections are divided into two categories: A and B. Those in category A are routine, and those in category B are challenging. However, not all exercises in category B are uniformly challenging. Some of those exercises are included because students find them somewhat difficult. </p> <p> I have tried to maintain an approach that is mathematically rigorous and, at the same time, closely matches the historical development of probability. Whenever appropriate, I include historical remarks, and also include discussions of a number of probability problems published in recent years in journals such as <i>Mathematics Magazine</i> and <i>American Mathematical Monthly.</i> These are interesting and instructive problems that deserve discussion in classrooms. </p> <p> Chapter 13 concerns computer simulation. That chapter is divided into several sections, presenting algorithms that are used to find approximate solutions to complicated probabilistic problems. These sections can be discussed independently when relevant materials from earlier chapters are being taught, or they can be discussed concurrently, toward the end of the semester. Although I believe that the emphasis should remain on concepts, methodology, and the mathematics of the subject, I also think that students should be asked to read the material on simulation and perhaps do some projects. Computer simulation is an excellent means to acquire insight into the nature of a problem, its functions, its magnitude, and the characteristics of the solution. </p> <p><b>Other Continuing Features</b></p> <ul> <li>The historical roots and applications of many of the theorems and definitions are presented in detail, accompanied by suitable examples or counterexamples.</li> <li>As much as possible, examples and exercises for each section do not refer to exercises in other chapters or sections&#x2014;a style that often frustrates students and instructors.</li> <li>Whenever a new concept is introduced, its relationship to preceding concepts and theorems is explained.</li><li> </li><li>Although the usual analytic proofs are given, simple probabilistic arguments are presented to promote deeper understanding of the subject.</li> <li>The book begins with discussions on probability and its definition, rather than with combinatorics. I believe that combinatorics should be taught after students have learned the preliminary concepts of probability. The advantage of this approach is that the need for methods of counting will occur naturally to students, and the connection between the two areas becomes clear from the beginning. Moreover, combinatorics becomes more interesting and enjoyable.</li> <li>Students beginning their study of probability have a tendency to think that sample spaces always have a finite number of sample points. To minimize this proclivity, the concept of <i>random selection of a point from an interval</i> is introduced in Chapter 1 and applied where appropriate throughout the, book. Moreover, since the basis of simulating indeterministic problems is selection of random points from (0, 1), in order to understand simulations, students need to be thoroughly familiar with that concept.</li> <li>Often, when we think of a collection of events, we have a tendency to think about them in either temporal or logical sequence. So, if, for example, a sequence of events A1, A2, . . . , An occur in time or in some logical order, we can usually immediately write down the probabilities P(A1), P(A2 A1), ..., P(An A1A2 . . . An-1) without much computation. However, we may be interested in probabilities of the intersection of events, or probabilities of events unconditional on the rest, or probabilities of earlier events, given later events. These three questions motivated the need for the law of multiplication, the law of total probability, and B ayes' theorem. I have given the law of multiplication a section of its own so that each of these fundamental uses of conditional probability would have its full share of attention and coverage.</li> <li>The concepts of expectation and variance are introduced early, because important concepts should be defined and used as soon as possible. One benefit of this practice is that, when random variables such as Poisson and normal are studied, the associated parameters will be understood immediately rather than remaining ambiguous until expectation and variance are introduced. Therefore, from the beginning, students will develop a natural feeling about such parameters.</li> <li>Special attention is paid to the Poisson distribution; it is made clear that this distribution is frequently applicable, for two reasons: first, because it approximates the binomial distribution and, second, it is the mathematical model for an enormous class of phenomena. The comprehensive presentation of the Poisson process and its applications can be understood by junior- and senior-level students.</li> <li>Students often have difficulties understanding functions or quantities such as the density function of a continuous random variable and the formula for mathematical expectation. For example, they may wonder why f xf (x) dx is the appropriate definition for E(X) and why correction for continuity is necessary. I have explained the reason behind such definitions, theorems, and concepts, and have demonstrated why they are the natural extensions of discrete cases.</li> <li>The first six chapters include many examples and exercises concerning selection of random points from intervals. Consequently, in Chapter 7, when discussing uniform random variables, I have been able to calculate the distribution and (by differentiation) the density function of X, a random point from an interval (a, b). In this way the concept of a uniform random variable and the definition of its density function are readily motivated.</li> <li>In Chapters 7 and 8 the usefulness of uniform densities is shown by using many examples. In particular, applications of uniform density in <i>geometric probability theory</i> are emphasized.</li> <li>Normal density, arguably the most important density function, is readily motivated by De Moivre's theorem. In Section 7.2, I introduce the standard normal density, the elementary version of the central limit theorem, and the normal density just as they were developed historically. Experience shows this to be a good pedagogical approach. When teaching this approach, the normal density becomes natural and does not look like a strange function appearing out of the blue.</li> <li>Exponential random variables naturally occur as <i>times between consecutive events of Poisson processes.</i> The time of occurrence of the <i>n</i>th event of a Poisson process has a gamma distribution. For these reasons I have motivated exponential and gamma distributions by Poisson processes. In this way we can obtain many examples of exponential and gamma random variables from the abundant examples of Poisson processes already known. Another advantage is that it helps us visualize memoryless random variables by looking at the interevent times of Poisson processes.</li> <li>Joint distributions and conditioning are often trouble areas for students. A detailed explanation and many applications concerning these concepts and techniques make these materials somewhat easier for students to understand.</li> <li>The concepts of covariance and correlation are motivated thoroughly.</li> <li>A subsection on pattern appearance is presented in Section 10.1. Even though the method discussed in this subsection is intuitive and probabilistic, it should help the students understand such paradoxical-looking results as the following. On the average, it takes almost twice as many flips of a fair coin to obtain a sequence of five successive heads as it does to obtain a tail followed by four heads.</li> <li>The answers to the odd-numbered exercises are included at the end of the book.</li> </ul> <p><b>New To This Edition</b></p> <p> Since 2000, when the second edition of this book was published, I have received much additional correspondence and feedback from faculty and students in this country and abroad. The comments, discussions, recommendations, and reviews helped me to improve the book in many ways. All detected errors were corrected, and the text has been fine-tuned for accuracy. More explanations and clarifying comments have been added to almost every section. In this edition, 278 new exercises and examples, mostly of an applied nature, have been added. More insightful and better solutions are given for a number of problems and exercises. For example, I have discussed Borel's normal number theorem, and I have presented a version of a famous set which is not an event. If a fair coin is tossed a very large number of times, the general perception is that heads occurs as often as tails. In a new subsection, in Section 11.4, I have explained what is meant by "heads occurs as often as tails." </p> <p> Some of the other features of the present revision are the following: </p> <ul> <li>An introductory chapter on stochastic processes is added. That chapter covers more in-depth material on Poisson processes. It also presents the basics of Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, and Brownian motion. The topics are covered in some depth. Therefore, the current edition has enough material for a second course in probability as well. The level of difficulty of the chapter on stochastic processes is consistent with the rest of the book. I believe the explanations in the new edition of the book make some challenging material more easily accessible to undergraduate and beginning graduate students. We assume only calculus as a prerequisite. Throughout the chapter, as examples, certain important results from such areas as queuing theory, random walks, branching processes, superposition of Poisson processes, and compound Poisson processes are discussed. I have also explained what the famous theorem, PASTA, <i>Poisson Arrivals See Time Average,</i> states. In short, the chapter on stochastic processes is laying the foundation on which students' further pure and applied probability studies and work can build.</li> <li>Some practical, meaningful, nontrivial, and relevant applications of probability and stochastic processes in finance, economics, and actuarial sciences are presented.</li> <li>Ever since 1853, when Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884) began his breeding experiments with the garden pea Pisum sativum, probability has played an importaut role in the understanding of the principles of heredity. In this edition, I have included more genetics examples to demonstrate the extent of that role.</li> <li>To study the risk or rate of "failure," per unit of time of "lifetimes" that have already survived a certain length of time, I have added a new section, Survival Analysis and Hazard Functions, to Chapter 7.</li> <li>For random sums of random variables, I have discussed Wald's equation and its analogous case for variance. Certain applications of Wald's equation have been discussed in the exercises, as well as in Chapter 12, Stochastic Processes.</li> <li>To make the order of topics more natural, the previous editions' Chapter 8 is broken into two separate chapters, Bivariate Distributions and Multivariate Distributions. As a result, the section Transformations of Two Random Variables has been covered earlier along with the material on bivariate distributions, and the convolution theorem has found a better home as an example of transformation methods. That theorem is now presented as a motivation for introducing moment-generating functions, since it cannot be extended so easily to many random variables.</li> </ul> <p><b>Sample Syllabi</b></p> <p> For a one-term course on probability, instructors have been able to omit many sections without difficulty. The book is designed for students with different levels of ability, and a variety of probability courses, applied and/or pure, can be taught using this book. A typical one-semester course on probability would cover Chapters 1 and 2; Sections 3.13.5; Chapters 4, 5, 6; Sections 7.1-7.4; Sections 8.1-8.3; Section 9.1; Sections 10.1-10.3; and Chapter 11. </p> <p> A follow-up course on introductory stochastic processes, or on a more advanced probability would cover the remaining material in the book with an emphasis on Sections 8.4, 9.2-9.3, 10.4 and, especially, the entire Chapter 12. </p> <p> A course on <b>discrete probability</b> would cover Sections 1.1-1.5; Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5; The subsections Joint Probability Mass Functions, Independence of Discrete Random Variables, and Conditional Distributions: Discrete Case, from Chapter 8; the subsection Joint Probability Mass Functions, from Chapter 9; Section 9.3; selected discrete topics from Chapters 10 and 11; and Section 12.3. </p> <p><b>Web Site</b></p> <p> For the issues concerning this book, such as reviews and errata, the Web site </p> <p> <b>http://mars.wnec.edu/~sghahram/probabilitybooks.html</b> </p> <p> is established. In this Web site, I may also post new examples, exercises, and topics that I will write for future editions. </p> <p><b>Solutions Manual</b></p> <p> I have written an <i>Instructor's Solutions Manual</i> that gives detailed solutions to virtually all of the 1224 exercises of the book.

Ben Hunt&#39;s classic has earned a reputation as the&#34; authentic handbook since it was first published in 1939. Updated in 1974, it remains the only step-by-step guide to building log cabins and log furniture -- pioneer style.&#34;</p><p><b>The only step-by-step guide to building log cabins and log furniture&#x2014;Pioneer style</b> <p>There are other manuals on building cabins, but W. Ben Hunt's is the <i>only</i> one to show you how to build and furnish an authentic pioneer cabin-the easy, natural way, using only hand tools and the woods around you. Our ancestors used logs and hand tools to build durable, dry, windproof, and protective dwellings; and they fashioned chairs, tables, branches, and bushes. In this day of power saws, lumberyards, and high prices, it's good to know that you can build in the same way.</p> <p><b>How to Build a Log Cabin</b><br> <i>Part One</i> provides complete directions for building cabins of three sizes: one-room, one-room and lean-to, and three-room. Just follow the clear instructions on every step of construction from choosing the site, clearing the tract, and building the foundation to installing fixtures, heating, and lighting.</p> <p><b>How to Furnish a Log Cabin</b><br> If you're not ready to build an entire cabin, you can try your hand at some of the small furnishings such as lamps, fences, and candlesticks. <i>Part Two</i> tells all you need to know to build and finish rustic furniture for an entire home: benches, tables, chairs, beds, cots, shelves, candelabras, gates, arbors, wayside stands, even road signs and birdhouses.</p> <p><b>"Two Books in One"</b><br> There are really two books in one here: <i>Building a Log Cabin</i>, published in 1947, and <i>Rustic Construction</i>, published in 1939. These two classics have been reproduced exactly as they first appeared, with the drawings and photographs that W. Ben Hunt selected and produced for the original editions.</p>W. BEN HUNT, a self-taught expert on the crafts of the Plains and Woodland Indians, was born in Wisconsin in 1888. Most of his life was spent teaching, creating artwork, building cabins and furniture, and lecturing about the out-of-doors. He is the author of many books, including Macmillan&#39;s The Complete How-to Book of Indiancraft.</p><h2>The Amber Spyglass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 3)(Rough-cut)</h2><p>PUBLISHED IN 40 COUNTRIES, with over 5 million copies in print in North America alone, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy -<i>The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife</i>, and <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> - has graced the <i>New York Times, Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, Book Sense</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly </i>bestseller lists. <br><br>For these deluxe editions, Philip Pullman has created new material: papers of Lord Asrial for <i>The Golden Compass</i> (15 new pages), papers of Colonel John Parry for the 10-year anniversary of <i>The Subtle Knife </i>(15 new pages), and letters of Mary Malone from secret Magisterium files for <i>The Amber Spyglass </i>(10 new pages). In each book, the new material has been illustrated and handlettered by renowned artist Ian Beck and will be included in the backmatter.<br> <br> Each deluxe edition also features a ribbon bookmark, rough-edged pages, and Pullman's own chapter-opening spot art. These volumes form a gorgeous collectible set of the trilogy - a perfect gift for loyal Pullman readers and new fans alike.</p><p>From the very start of its very first scene, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> will set hearts fluttering and minds racing. All we'll say here is that we immediately discover who captured Lyra at the end of <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, though we've yet to discern whether this individual's intent is good, evil, or somewhere in between. We also learn that Will still possesses the blade that allows him to cut between worlds, and has been joined by two winged companions who are determined to escort him to Lord Asriel's mountain redoubt. The boy, however, has only one goal in mind--to rescue his friend and return to her the alethiometer, an instrument that has revealed so much to her and to readers of <i>The Golden Compass</i> and its follow-up. Within a short time, too, we get to experience the "tingle of the starlight" on Serafina Pekkala's skin as she seeks out a famished Iorek Byrnison and enlists him in Lord Asriel's crusade: <blockquote> A complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumors of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. </blockquote> Meanwhile, two factions of the Church are vying to reach Lyra first. One is even prepared to give a priest "preemptive absolution" should he succeed in committing mortal sin. For these tyrants, killing this girl is no less than "a sacred task." <p> In the final installment of his trilogy, Philip Pullman has set himself the highest hurdles. He must match its predecessors in terms of sheer action and originality <i>and</i> resolve the enigmas he already created. The good news is that there is no critical bad news--not that <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> doesn't contain standoffs and close calls galore. (Who would have it otherwise?) But Pullman brings his audacious revision of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to a conclusion that is both serene and devastating. In prose that is transparent yet lyrical and 3-D, the author weaves in and out of his principals' thoughts. He also offers up several additional worlds. In one, Dr. Mary Malone is welcomed into an apparently simple society. The environment of the <i>mulefa</i> (again, we'll reveal nothing more) makes them rich in consciousness while their lives possess a slow and stately rhythm. These strange creatures can, however, be very fast on their feet (or on other things entirely) when necessary. Alas, they are on the verge of dying as Dust streams out of their idyllic landscape. Will the Oxford dark-matter researcher see her way to saving them, or does this require our young heroes? And while Mary is puzzling out a cure, Will and Lyra undertake a pilgrimage to a realm devoid of all light and hope, after having been forced into the cruelest of sacrifices--or betrayals. </p><p> Throughout his galvanizing epic, Pullman sustains scenes of fierce beauty and tenderness. He also allows us a moment or two of comic respite. At one point, for instance, Lyra's mother bullies a series of ecclesiastical underlings: "The man bowed helplessly and led her away. The guard behind her blew out his cheeks with relief." Needless to say, Mrs. Coulter is as intoxicating and fluid as ever. And can it be that we will come to admire her as she plays out her desperate endgame? In this respect, as in many others, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> is truly a book of revelations, moving from darkness visible to radiant truth. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of "The Golden Compass and "The Subtle Knife to a heart-stopping end, marking the final volume of His Dark Materials as the most powerful of the trilogy. <br>Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and Iorek Byrnison the armored bear, come a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spymaster to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. So, too, come startling revelations: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live--and who will die--for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that--in its shocking outcome--will uncover the secret of Dust. Philip Pullman deftly brings the cliff-hangers and mysteries of His Dark Materials to an earthshattering conclusion--and confirms his fantasy trilogy as an undoubted and enduring classic.</p><h2>The Panda&#39;s Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History</h2><p><p><strong>"Gould is a natural writer; he has something to say and the inclination and skill with which to say it." &#x2015;P.

In the pre-Inca period such<br>notions of parallel descent were expressions of complementarity between<br>men and women. Examining the interplay between gender ideologies<br>and political hierarchy. Irene Silverblatt shows how Inca rulers<br>used their Sun and Moon traditions as methods of controlling<br>women and the Andean peoples the Incas conquered. She then explores<br>the process by which the Spaniards employed European male<br>and female imageries to establish their own rule in Peru and to make<br>new inroads on the power of native women, particularly poor peasant<br>women.</p><p>Harassed economically and abused sexually, Andean women<br>fought back, earning in the process the Spaniards' condemnation as<br>"witches." Fresh from the European witch hunts that damned<br>women for susceptibility to heresy and diabolic influence, Spanish<br>clerics were predisposed to charge politically disruptive poor women<br>with witchcraft. Professor Silverblatt shows that these very accusations<br>provided women with an ideology of rebellion and a method for<br>defending their culture.</p></p><p><p>"This is a rich and compelling analysis--well conceived, innovative, and dealing with important frontiers in several fields.

Includes leading software demo disks."They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Maybe they should have said a thousand dollars. After all, we're talking here about using pictures to make money."<br> &#x2014;from The Visual Investor <p>As the host of CNBC's popular Tech Talk with John Murphy and the author of two landmark books, Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets and Intermarket Technical Analysis, John J. Murphy is one of the leading names in technical analysis today. He now brings his expertise and insight to The Visual Investor, a comprehensive and thoroughly accessible guide to visual analysis. Highlighting its essential components, Murphy takes you through the ins and outs of reading price and volume charts, "pictures" that can help you make sensible investment decisions&#x2014;and a healthy profit. Special emphasis is placed on sector and global investing through mutual funds. Murphy shows you how to chart and analyze the mutual funds themselves.</p> <p>Visual analysis enables an investor to analyze a stock or industry group without complicated mathematical formulas and technical concepts. Instead, it tells you&#x2014;simply and quickly&#x2014;whether or not the fundamentals of a particular stock are bullish or bearish from the direction in which the price is moving. As Murphy points out, the key to visual analysis is being able to discern whether this stock price is going up or down, not why it is behaving the way it is: "Knowing the reasons behind a stock's movement are interesting . . . [but] all that really matters is a picture, a simple line on a chart."</p> <p>The Visual Investor brings the complexities of technical analysis into sharp focus, enabling you to make sense of these lines. Providing an in-depth overview, Murphy covers all the fundamentals, from chart types and market indicators to sector analysis and global investing. With actual examples and easy-to-read charts, you'll learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Spot significant support and resistance levels</li> <li>Understand the role volume plays in confirming price action</li> <li>Use moving averages to help keep track of trends</li> <li>Discern the difference between markets that are trending and those that aren't</li> <li>Determine whether a market is overbought or oversold using oscillator systems</li> </ul> <p>To get started on your own visual analysis, The Visual Investor contains a complete resource section that lists important publishing and educational resources, as well as software products and data vendors.</p></p><h2>First Aid/CPR/AED Participant&#39;s Manual</h2><p>Used.

Think about it &#x2014; over centuries of time, God supernaturally moved upon a number of men&#x2019;s hearts, resulting in them writing down the exact words of God. God then led His people to recognize these divine writings and to distinguish them from everything else that has ever been written. Then God&#x2019;s people brought these 66 books together. The preservation and survival of the Bible is as miraculous as its writing. Then God gave men technological knowledge to copy and transmit the Bible so that all people could have it. All of this took place because God has something to say to you.<br><br>With Foundations, you can read through all 66 of the miraculous books of the Bible in one year, while still having the flexibility of reading 5 days per week. Along with supplementary devotional content each day, you can experience the miracle of reading and responding to the entirety of God&#x2019;s Word. By using the H.E.A.R. journaling method, you will be guided through Highlighting, Explaining, Applying, and Responding to passages, allowing for practical application throughout the year-long plan.<br> <br>Features:<br>-1-year devotional book<br>-5 days of reading per week fits into busy schedules<br>-Full Bible reading plan that can easily be accomplished in one year<br>-Daily devotional material will help reader correlate daily reading and real-life application<br><br>Benefits:<br>-Expand your understanding of the Bible by just being in the Word of God 5 days per week<br>-Accomplish your long-standing goal of reading through the Bible cover-to-cover in a flexible 5-day per week plan that accommodates your busy schedule.<br>-Experience personal spiritual growth<br>-Provides the opportunity for men and women to dig deeper into Scripture as individuals or with a group<br>-Guides readers to sit and reflect on the truth of Scripture using the H.E.A.R. journaling method<br>-Practical devotional for new or inexperienced Bible study students as well as those who are well-versed in the Scriptures</p><p>Robby Gallaty is a friend, a godly husband and father, and a pastor who is passionate about the Word and discipling people. The resource he and Kandi, his wife, have developed, Foundations, is outstanding. Both new and seasoned believers often struggle with where to start in their&nbsp;study of God's Word. And not only where to start, but what to do after they have read a portion of Scripture.<br>&nbsp;<br>Studying Scripture can be overwhelming at times. Where do I begin? How do I make Bible reading a regular part of my life with my busy schedule? Robby and Kandi have answered all of those questions in this important resource. Not only have they identified key verses of Scripture to pore over, they have laid them out in such a way that you see the entire story arch of the Bible. They have chosen foundational passages of Scripture that every disciple needs to know so<br>that you have an intentional plan as you go. Plus, they have provided a simple and easy tool to help you unpack Scripture in order to help you better understand and respond to God's Word. I trust Robby. His experience as a pastor who disciples others and faithfully teaches the Word gives him the necessary perspective to develop an important resource like this one.<br>&nbsp;<br>I challenge you to take this journey seriously.

Taking account of the most recent scholarship, Manfred Kuehn allows the reader to follow the same journey that Kant himself took in emerging as a central figure in modern philosophy. Manfred Kuehn was formerly Professor of Philosophy at Purdue University. A specialist on German philosophy of the period, he is the author of numerous articles and papers on Immanuel Kant.</p><p>This is the first full-length biography in more than fifty years of Immanuel Kant, one of the giants amongst the pantheon of Western philosophers as well as the one with the most powerful and broad influence on contemporary philosophy.Taking account of the most recent scholarship Professor Kuehn allows the reader (whether interested in philosophy, history, politics, German culture, or religion) to follow the same journey that Kant himself took in emerging as a central figure in modern philosophy.For opposite reasons, Kant's life (1724-1804) and ideas are equally difficult to expound engagingly: the ideas, because of their philosophical complexity; the life, because of its uneventful simplicity. Acknowledging as much in his prologue to this earnest biographical effort, Kuehn (of Philipps University in Germany) largely succeeds at this daunting, two-fold task. Nonspecialist readers in philosophy will be intrigued by the lesser-known works of Kant summarized here, such as Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, on the mystical theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, or, more relevant to our own copyright-obsessed times, "On the Injustice of Counterfeiting Books." Seasoned students of Kant will appreciate Kuehn's attention to the genesis of Kant's enormously influential critical philosophy in specific events and epiphanies of his life. Most notably, he explains how a foundational tenet of Kantian thought--that sensation and intellect are discontinuous (propounded in defiance of the then commonly received philosophy of Christian Wolff)--originates in a little-known Latin dissertation that Kant publicly defended in 1770, 11 years before the Critique of Pure Reason appeared. Or again, the categorical imperative, which defines Kantian ethics, owes in part, Kuehn suggests, to the influence on Kant of his long-time English friend, Joseph Green, who first lived the kind of principled life for which Kant then laid the theory. Kuehn's descriptions of Kant's richly inclusive social life, witty conversation and elegant dress will delight all who have wrongly identified the sage of K&#x201d;nigsberg with dour dispassion. The biography, however, suffers from repetition, digression and excessive attention to characters of only passing general interest. Still, as the first biography of the great philosopher in more than 50 years, this is a welcome addition to the literature. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Japanese For Dummies</h2><p><b>Learn to speak Japanese&#x2014;the fast and easy way</b> <p>Japanese is the gateway to the rich culture of the exciting and complex island nation of Japan.

This is Robert Louis Stevenson's harrowing tale of good and evil -- caught in the same person.</p><p>Two comic-book veterans condense Stevenson's well-known psychological thriller into 40 pages in this slim graphic-novel adaptation. Following closely to the original, Grant's adaptation portrays the enigmatic Dr. Jekyll, as pursued by the lawyer Mr. Utterson. When Utterson hears rumors of a ruthless maniac named Mr. Hyde, he begins an investigation into Hyde's background. As he deepens his search, he makes the startling discovery that Jekyll and Hyde are actually the same person. Grant's reworking should serve as an adequate introduction for younger readers interested in Stevenson's work. Kennedy's illustrations, while brightly colored, are somewhat flat, with a consistently straight-on point-of-view; the overuse of this angle becomes tiring. As far as graphic-novel adaptations go, this one is rather pedestrian: There are no real standout features, though no glaring detractions. And not much popular appeal, either, unless classics adapted in this form are actively being sought.

Why do street criminals get stiff prison sentences, a practice that has led to the disaster of mass incarceration, while white-collar criminals, who arguably harm more people, get slaps on the wrist--if they are prosecuted at all? In <i>Who Are the Criminals?</i>, one of America's leading criminologists provides new answers to these vitally important questions by telling how the politicization of crime in the twentieth century transformed and distorted crime policymaking and led Americans to fear street crime too much and corporate crime too little.</p><br><p> John Hagan argues that the recent history of American criminal justice can be divided into two eras--the age of Roosevelt (roughly 1933 to 1973) and the age of Reagan (1974 to 2008). A focus on rehabilitation, corporate regulation, and the social roots of crime in the earlier period was dramatically reversed in the later era. In the age of Reagan, the focus shifted to the harsh treatment of street crimes, especially drug offenses, which disproportionately affected minorities and the poor and resulted in wholesale imprisonment. At the same time, a massive deregulation of business provided new opportunities, incentives, and even rationalizations for white-collar crime--and helped cause the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession.</p><br><p> The time for moving beyond Reagan-era crime policies is long overdue, Hagan argues. The understanding of crime must be reshaped and we must reconsider the relative harms and punishments of street and corporate crimes. In a new afterword, Hagan assesses Obama's policies regarding the punishment of white-collar and street crimes and debates whether there is any evidence of a significant change in the way our country punishes them.</p></p><p><p>"This critically important book offers an incisive analysis of the links between the increase in incarceration for street crime in the last several decades and deregulation of the business suites. It is simultaneously a scholarly tour de force and a sweeping indictment of the political uses of crime."<b>--Kitty Calavita, University of California, Irvine</b></p><p>"John Hagan shows that the stories of street crime and white-collar crime are not separate, but interwoven. He also closely ties together the histories of politics, policymaking, criminal justice practice, and criminological thought. This book could only have been written by someone with the expertise that Hagan has amassed over many decades of intense and extremely productive research. This is a significant contribution indeed."<b>--Joachim J. Savelsberg, University of Minnesota</b></p><p>"This is an important and in many respects brilliant book. The analyses of criminology in the ages of Roosevelt and Reagan are masterful. At its most ambitious, the book aspires to frame a new kind of criminology that breaks with the belief that government stands between society and the dangerous. This is an exciting vision."<b>--Jonathan Simon, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><b>John Hagan</b> is the John D.

He is an internationally renowned Dickens scholar.<br>One of the most popular writers of the nineteenth century, Charles Dickens created a world of unique and fascinating characters whose stories continue to captivate contemporary readers. During the past five years, a remarkable number of major reference sources pertaining to this beloved author have been published, among them George Newlin's <i>Everyone in Dickens</i> (Greenwood, 1995), Donald Hawes's <i>Who's Who in Dickens </i>(Routledge, 1998), and Paul Davis's <i>Charles Dickens A to Z</i> [RBB O 1 98].<p>In this latest compendium, Schlicke, a senior lecturer at Aberdeen University and noted Dickens specialist, has tapped the knowledge and expertise of more than 60 distinguished contributors to assemble a dictionary that encompasses not only Dickens's life and writings but also the entire period in which he lived. The more than 500 signed entries are arranged alphabetically, with the exception of the entries for Dickens's works, which appear somewhat out of sequence, with <i>see </i>references guiding the user to their correct location. Although scholarly, the entries are highly readable, and many include brief bibliographic references. In addition to entries on specific people, publications, institutions, places, genres, activities, and events, the dictionary also contains articles on a wide range of broader topics. Some of these relate directly to Dickens' life and works (e.g., <i>Characterization</i>, <i>Homes of Dickens</i>, <i>Television adaptations of Dickens</i>), while others deal with aspects of his times (e.g., <i>Industry</i>, <i>Reform</i>). Although some articles are only one or two paragraphs, many others are multipage essays, such as the 15-page entry <i>London </i>and the 11-page entry <i>Criticism and scholarship</i>. Entries on Dickens' novels follow a set format, which includes discussion of the work's inception, publication history, illustrations, sources, and critical reception, in addition to a brief plot summary. Wisely, Schlicke has chosen not to provide separate entries on individual characters, which would only duplicate the information in other reference sources; instead, he appends a list of names of characters keyed to the works in which they appear.</p><p>Enhancing the text are more than 50 black-and-white illustrations and four maps of places associated with Dickens. Other helpful features include a chronological chart that correlates major events in Dickens' life with significant historical and literary events, a Dickens family tree, and a general bibliography. The index identifies names, associations, publications, and other subjects that receive substantial treatment within broader articles. Unfortunately, however, it only notes the entry header(s) under which they appear, rather than giving a precise page reference. Providing additional access is a classified list of articles that groups entries under useful categories, such as <i>Dickens' non-fiction</i>, <i>politics and government</i>, and<i> theatre and other kinds of entertainment</i>.</p><p>This excellent work gives the user a renewed appreciation for the tremendous range of Dickens' interests and talents and provides fresh insights into the age in which he lived. Its strong emphasis on and extensive coverage of the political, social, and artistic milieu surrounding Dickens and his circle set it apart from the aforementioned <i>Charles Dickens A to Z</i>, which treats those aspects much more briefly. On the other hand, that compilation, with its 2,500 entries, offers its own unique strengths, including lengthy, detailed synopses of each novel and separate entries for individual characters, articles, and essays. Although there is inevitable overlap between the two works, they effectively complement each other. <i>Charles Dickens A to Z</i> is more appropriate for general readers and for undergraduate and high-school students, while the <i>Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens</i> is particularly suited for scholars and other serious researchers. <i></i></p></p><h2>So Far from Home: Lost and Found in Our Brave New World</h2><p>I wrote this book for you if you offer your work as a contribution to others, whatever your work might be, and if now you find yourself feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and sometimes despairing even as you paradoxically experience moments of joy, belonging, and greater resolve to do your work.<br><br> This book describes how we can do our good work with dedication, energy, discipline, and joy by consciously choosing a new role for ourselves, that of warriors for the human spirit.<br><br> This book contains maps of how we ended up in a world nobody wants&#x2014;overtaken by greed, self-interest, and oppressive power&#x2014;the very opposite of what we worked so hard to create.

She is the author of six other books.SEEING WHAT IS<br><br> I&#x2019;m sitting on the banks of the Virgin River in Zion National Park, my favorite place on the planet. The river is confidently, casually flowing through this magnificent canyon that it has been carving out for about two million years.<br><br> The canyon has created one of Earth&#x2019;s most sacred places. It has been a dry winter, so the river is low, ambling peacefully along. I&#x2019;ve been here at other times when it&#x2019;s fierce, flooding, destructive. Next time I&#x2019;m back it will be different again.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve learned a lot from rivers, starting with the teacher stream I wrote about in Leadership and the New Science. That lovely mountain stream taught me about process structures, things that have clear identity and intention yet constantly adapt to circumstances and conditions, changing their form as needed. Streams take many forms yet never lose their way, which is unerringly to the ocean. Along the way, they create magnificent canyons, wreak terrible destruction, provide sustenance to farms and communities, provide pleasure and pain to those who live along their banks. This is the pattern of life&#x2014;changing, adapting, creating and destroying.<br><br> The Hopi Native American elders describe this time&#x2014;our time&#x2014;as a river flowing now very fast, great, and swift. They warn us not to hold on to the shore, the place of security and old ways, because those who do &#x201c;will be torn apart and suffer greatly.&#x201d; They encourage us to push off into the middle of the river and to keep our heads above water.3<br><br> These river images, even the most turbulent ones, no longer describe this time for me. I need a more violent image of disruption and dread to describe what I&#x2019;m seeing and how I&#x2019;m feeling. It is Yeats&#x2019; dark vision that speaks to me, written in 1919 in the troubled years after the First World War:<br><br> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br><br> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br><br> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br><br> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br><br> A Confession of Innocence<br><br> Many of us&#x2014;certainly I&#x2019;d describe myself in these terms&#x2014;were anxiously engaged in &#x201c;the ceremony of innocence.&#x201d; We didn&#x2019;t think we were innocents, but we were. We thought we could change the world. We even believed that, with sufficient will and passion, we could &#x201c;create a world,&#x201d; one that embodied our aspirations for justice, equality, opportunity, peace, a world where, in Paulo Freire&#x2019;s terms, &#x201c;it would be easier to love.&#x201d; (The gifted publisher of this and all my books, Berrett-Koehler, aspires &#x201c;To create a world that works for all.&#x201d;) This vision, this hope, this possibility motivated me for most of my life. It still occasionally seduces me into contemplating what might be the next project, the next collaboration, the next big idea that could turn this world around. But I&#x2019;m learning to resist the temptation.<br><br> This is not a book that contemplates what we might do next, what we&#x2019;ve learned from all our efforts, where we might put our energy and experience in order to create positive change. I no longer believe that we can save the world. Powerful, life-destroying dynamics have been set in motion that cannot be stopped. We&#x2019;re on a disastrous course with each other and with the planet. We&#x2019;ve lost track of our best human qualities and forgotten the real sources of satisfaction, meaning and joy.<br><br> This book was born from my clarity that greed, self-interest and coercive power are destroying the very life force of this planet. I don&#x2019;t know whether such destruction is intentional or not, but I observe it happening everywhere. I was hit in the face with this while in South Africa in November 2011. South Africa is the country of my heart, always teaching me about the depths of human experience. I&#x2019;ve been working there since 1995 and this was my fourteenth visit. In the years of Nelson Mandela, hope was palpable. Everyone seemed to be starting projects to tackle huge social problems, eager to work with others to create the New South Africa. They understood the complexity of all the issues, they knew it was &#x201c;a long walk to freedom,&#x201d;4 and they had great faith in their future.<br><br> But now, for many reasons, hope is hard to find and the good people who have created successful projects and built effective non-government organizations (NGOs) are exhausted and demoralized. They keep doing their work, but it&#x2019;s now a constant struggle. They struggle for funds, they struggle with inept, corrupt bureaucracy, they struggle with the loss of community and the rise of self-interest, they struggle with the indifference of the newly affluent. The dream of a new nation of possibility, equality, and justice has fallen victim to the self-serving behaviors of those with power.<br><br> Please do not think this is only true in South Africa. It&#x2019;s happening everywhere, as you may have noticed.<br><br> Indestructible Motivation<br><br> Yet I have not set out to write a book that increases our despair. Quite the contrary. My intention is that we do our work with greater resolve and energy, with more delight and confidence, even as we understand that it won&#x2019;t turn this world around. Our work is essential; we just have to hold it differently. This was beautifully described by V�clav Havel, leader of the Velvet Revolution, the poet-playwright who then became president of the new Czech Republic: &#x201c;Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.&#x201d;5<br><br> How do we find this deep confidence that, independent of results, our work is the right work for us to be doing? How do we give up needing hope to be our primary motivator? How do we replace hope of creating change with confidence that we&#x2019;re doing the right work?<br><br> Hope is such a dangerous source of motivation. It&#x2019;s an ambush, because what lies in wait is hope&#x2019;s ever-present companion, fear: the fear of failing, the despair of disappointment, the bitterness and exhaustion that can overtake us when our best, most promising efforts are rebuked, undone, ignored, destroyed. As someone commented, &#x201c;Expectation is premeditated disappointment.&#x201d;<br><br> My great teachers these days are people who no longer need hope in order to do their work, even though their projects and organizations began with bright, hope-filled dreams. As &#x201c;the blood-dimmed tide&#x201d; of greed, fear, and oppression drowns out their voices and washes away their good work, they become more committed to their work, not because it will succeed, but just because it is right for them to be doing it. I watch their inner struggles and bouts with despair, but mostly what I notice is their perseverance and confidence. They see how bad it is, they know it is getting worse, they realize their work won&#x2019;t create the changes they have worked hard for all these years. Yet they continue to do their work because they know it is theirs to do. Sometimes they say, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t not do this.&#x201d; Other times they ask, &#x201c;What else would I be doing if not this?&#x201d;<br><br> These brave people are true warriors. Seeing as clearly as they can, hearts as open as they can bear, they keep doing their work. They know how systems of power work and they try to discern wise actions. Though in frequent battles with politicians, leaders and bureaucrats, they strive to keep their hearts open and not to succumb to anger and aggression. Work is filled with constant challenges, and they know there will be many more.<br><br> Perhaps you see yourself in this description. Or perhaps you still rely on the hope that it&#x2019;s possible to save the world.</p><h2>How Can I Forgive You?: The Courage To Forgive, the Freedom Not To</h2><p><p>From bestselling author Janis Spring comes a long&#x2013;awaited second book which tackles the sensitive issue of forgiveness with anecdotes and clinical case material. The topic of forgiveness is fast becoming one of the key concepts in psychotherapy. Until now, explains Spring, we have bought into the myth that forgiving is not only good for you but is the only morally sound response to violation. We believe that there are only two choices, to forgive or not, and that forgiveness is an unconditional gift that does not have to be earned by the offender. In <em>How Can I Forgive You?</em>, Spring debunks these myths and offers a new way to think about this critical dynamic&#x2013;&#x2013;illuminating a middle ground between total forgiveness and not forgiving, an approach that enables the hurt party to maintain self&#x2013;respect and get on with their lives...</p><p> After years of observing people first hand in her clinical practice and witnessing their struggle to forgive and be forgiven, Spring has developed a model to help real people heal from real interpersonal injuries. She provides concrete, detailed, step&#x2013;by stop instructions for both the hurt party and the offender. Spring explains that there are many options. You can refuse to forgive, which is empowering but leaves you stewing. You can offer cheap forgiveness, which happens when you ignore your pain and will do anything to preserve the relationship. Or you can take the healthier paths of acceptance and genuine forgiveness. In Acceptance, you cut your own path and walk alone. In Genuine Forgiveness, the offender clears a path and walks beside you.The clinical examples run from the petty to the serious to the profane &#x2013; from a friend who forgets your birthday to a brother who refuses to help you take care of an elderly parent to a deliberate act of sexual abuse. </p><p> We are all struggling to forgive someone, and hate feeling ruptured in our significant relationships and fractured within ourselves. We are all searching for some new position that frees us from the corrosive effects of hate, gives voice to the injustice, and helps us to make peace with the person who hurt us and with ourselves. This book delivers some real answers to this critical interpersonal dilemma. </p></p><p><p>Janis Abrahms Spring, Ph.D., is a nationally acclaimed expert on issues of trust, intimacy, and forgiveness. In private practice in Westport, Connecticut, she is the author of the award-winning H<em>ow Can I Forgive You?, The Courage to Forgive, the Freedom Not To</em>, and <em>Life with Pop: Lessons on Caring for an Aging Parent</em>.</p>Abrahms Spring, a clinical psychologist, follows up her bestselling After the Affair with this new self-help manual that aims to provide a better way to forgive or not forgive others. With the assistance of her husband, and in clear, insightful writing, Abrahms Spring draws on many case studies to fully analyze four categories of forgiveness: cheap forgiveness, refusing to forgive, acceptance and genuine forgiveness. The author is convinced that morally and spiritually a person is no more required to forgive an unrepentant offender than he or she is to love him. When someone who has been truly wronged and forgives too easily (cheap forgiveness), that person is not acting in their own best interest, but rather preserving a relationship at any cost. An absolute refusal to forgive Abrahms, Spring posits, is also harmful to the injured person. Although punishing the offender may provide a sense of power, it also fosters negativity and self-isolation. The author advises that when genuine forgiveness is impossible, because the injury is too great or the offender will not apologize, a better decision than holding onto anger is to work through the injury, or acceptance. This healing process will lead to emotional resolution and the ability to move on with one's life. Genuine forgiveness, Abrahms Spring maintains, occurs when both parties negotiate a process during which the hurt person expresses his or her pain, and the offender apologizes and takes responsibility for his or her poor behavior. In the end, this is a thoughtful exposition on the nuanced role of forgiveness in relationships that goes beyond the average self-help book. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Henry David&#39;s House</h2><p>Young readers are introduced to Henry David Thoreau&#39;s masterpiece, Walden, through excerpts from the original work.</p><p>Steven Schnur is the author of several books for adults and children, including Summer: An Alphabet Acrostic and Spring Thaw, the award-winning middle-grade novel The Shadow Children, and two volumes of essays.

In addition, while most of the text is written in the past tense, the part in which Thoreau describes his completed house uses present verb forms and, thus, is a bit unsettling to the ear. Still, the overall effect of the words is to establish a mood of tranquility. That mood is greatly reinforced by the full-page watercolor illustrations, and their impressionistic style often focuses on selected aspects of the author's descriptions, rather than trying to retell the complete story visually. The soft palette underscores the peacefulness and quiet in Nature that Thoreau went out to seek. While this book is not likely to be embraced by casual readers, it will be particularly useful to teachers of art and science, and to literature specialists interested in introducing listeners either to Thoreau's literary style or to the concept of journal writing. Consider also pairing it with some nature poetry to inspire students in creative-writing classes.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Writing and Reporting News: A Coaching Method</h2><p>Prepare yourself for the changing world of journalism with WRITING AND REPORTING NEWS: A COACHING METHOD, the book that integrates new trends in the convergence of print, broadcast and online media while teaching fundamental skills.

Its diagnostic categories reflected the consensus of a multidisciplinary group of experts in early childhood development and mental health. The newly revised DC:0-3R draws on empirical research and clinical practice that have occurred worldwide since 1994. DC:0-3R is designed to help mental health and other professionals. The features include: recognize mental health and developmental challenges in young children; understand how relationships and environmental factors contribute to mental health and developmental disorders; use diagnostic criteria effectively for classification and intervention; and work more effectively with parents and other professionals to develop effective treatment plans. DC:0-3R enhances your ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat mental health problems in the earliest years by identifying and describing disorders not addressed in other classification systems and by pointing the way to effective intervention approaches.</p><p>This is the first systematic, developmentally based guide to classifying very young children&#x2019;s mental health and developmental difficulties. Its diagnostic categories reflect the consensus of a multidisciplinary group of experts in the fields of infant development and mental health. The revised edition draws on ten additional years of empirical research and clinical practice worldwide.&#34;The DC:0-3 framework acknowledges the importance of early relationships and moves us beyond classifying symptom patterns to a process of comprehensive and dynamic formulation of functional emotional level, developmental status, relationship context, and the meaning of a child&#39;s presenting behavioral pattern. The five axes of the DC:0-3 are effective in highlighting questions of differential diagnosis and the diagnostic system leads to a sensible treatment plan and to a more meaningful dialogue between clinicians and families.&#34; - Donna R.

For the first six months of my life, she couldn&#x2019;t get out of bed, leaving me in the care of my father and maternal grandmother.&nbsp; I actually didn&#x2019;t learn about this until I was forty-five,&nbsp;&nbsp; and someone casually mentioned it at a party. Sadly, the stigma of psychiatric illness was so great at the time (and still can be today) that families touched by chronic depression often had to carry the burden in silence.&nbsp; My parents had been counseled by doctors that they shouldn&#x2019;t discuss it, so they didn&#x2019;t.<br><br> My mother&nbsp; eventually&nbsp; recovered, but&nbsp; then&nbsp; she&nbsp; became bipolar, which meant there were days, months,&nbsp; and years when she&#x2019;d be&nbsp; fine,&nbsp; and then long periods when she was incapable of getting up, making dinner,&nbsp; or holding&nbsp;&nbsp; a conversation. During&nbsp; her manic phases, she&#x2019;d be on a high&nbsp; for&nbsp; days or weeks, talking&nbsp; nonstop&nbsp; and sometimes&nbsp; being cruel&nbsp; to me and others&nbsp; I know she loved. I couldn&#x2019;t predict when her disease would take control of her. Coming home from school, I never knew if I&#x2019;d be greeted by a fire-breathing dragon or a smiling mother with a glass of milk and a plate of cookies.&nbsp; I had to feel around the edges of the door for danger, the way they teach you in fire safety training.<br><br> When&nbsp; I was&nbsp; ten,&nbsp; my&nbsp; mother&nbsp;&nbsp; screamed at me&nbsp; for forty-five minutes because I left&nbsp; a sneaker&nbsp; on the steps.&nbsp; The only ten-year-old who hasn&#x2019;t left a sneaker on the steps is a ten-year-old who doesn&#x2019;t have sneakers or steps.<br><br> During an ugly scene when I was twelve or thirteen, I physically held my mother down in a chair and told her, &#x201c;You will stop yelling at my brother right now.&#x201d; That moment changed everything between us. She was my mother, and I loved her, but her disease was dangerous, and I had to be assertive.<br><br> Although my mother&#x2019;s illness was hard on me, it had to have been worse for my father. The instant I was born, he lost his wife. And yet he remained extraordinarily positive and strong. He was a genuine role model, the moral center of gravity for every community that he was in&#x2014;whether it was our larger family, the synagogue, the Boy Scouts, his business, or his trade association. He was the guy who would solve other people&#x2019;s problems. I could talk to Dad for hours.<br><br> By my early teens, I was actively involved in helping with my mother&#x2019;s care. That was when she received her first electroshock therapy treatment for recurring depression.&nbsp; Later, we had her on daily lithium, a mood stabilizer. I had to grow up and become a responsible caregiver at a very young age.<br><br> And here&#x2019;s where the story gets complicated. When I was in high school, my father came home one evening, clearly agitated. For me, the sun came up at night when my father walked through the door. As tired as he was, those hours with him were absolutely precious. If he came home anxious or upset, that was a big deal.<br><br> He had gone for his annual physical that day with his primary care physician, a man with&nbsp;&nbsp; whom he&#x2019;d attended high school in Newark, New Jersey. The doctor had recommended that my father see a certain cardiologist. A week or two later Dad came home even more rattled than before.&nbsp; The cardiologist had told him he needed to have open-heart surgery.<br><br> I was overcome with worry. Was my dad going to die? Losing him wouldn&#x2019;t just mean I&#x2019;d&nbsp; be an orphan,&nbsp; practically&nbsp; speaking; it would mean I&#x2019;d&nbsp; have to take full responsibility&nbsp; for my mother. That was not a reality I could handle.<br><br> That night I couldn&#x2019;t sleep. The next day I couldn&#x2019;t concentrate at school. I got home that afternoon and picked up the phone to dial Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Although we lived in suburban Union, New Jersey, I read The New York Times every night, and somehow I recalled &#x201c;Lenox Hill&#x201d; always being mentioned.&nbsp; I knew that when you wanted to go to a nice restaurant, see a good play, or go to a top hospital&#x2014;you went to New York.<br><br> &#x201c;Can I please speak to the head of cardiology?&#x201d; I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m sure my teenage voice must&nbsp;&nbsp; have cracked on the line as I spoke, but I wasn&#x2019;t going to aim low.<br><br> &#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; I announced when my father got home, &#x201c;I set up an appointment for you to get a second opinion&nbsp;&nbsp; from the chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know, that&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna do it.&#x201d; And that was that.<br><br> On the day of his appointment, I waited at home in agony. This had to go right. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine a future without him. I was seeing the walls coming down.<br><br> It was all I could do not to knock him over when he walked in the door. &#x201c;What did he say, Dad?&nbsp; What did he say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He said, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with your heart, and the doctor who recommended surgery should be shot in a public square.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> Exact words. He was ecstatic. And I still remember where I was standing in the kitchen when he said it. I remember this better than I remember what I had for breakfast today.<br><br> My father never had any heart problems.&nbsp; No high blood pressure, no calcium in his coronaries, no leaky valves. He passed away in 2007, succumbing to something totally unrelated to his heart. But back in 1988, when I was building my first company, I met Dr. Robert H. Brook, who was then the vice president and director of RAND Health, a health policy think tank. He had just published research showing that many of the major surgical procedures being done in the United States were harming rather than helping patients. In fact, when it came to coronary&nbsp; artery&nbsp; bypass&nbsp; graft&nbsp; surgeries&#x2014;what&nbsp; my father&nbsp; was told&nbsp; he needed&#x2014;14&nbsp; percent were done for &#x201c;inappropriate reasons,&#x201d; and 30 percent were done for &#x201c;equivocal&#x201d; reasons. I thought, My God, this doctor has found scientific evidence of what I suspected was going on some twenty years ago.<br><br> I still think of my father every day and how his &#x201c;case&#x201d; ignited my passion for helping people to get better care. Managing serious illness is not easy, but armed with&nbsp; the knowledge in this book, and the support&nbsp; of a trusted primary care doctor,&nbsp; I truly believe that everyone can&#x2014;and must&#x2014;become&nbsp; a&nbsp; more powerful&nbsp; and effective health care consumer.</p><h2>Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach</h2><p><b> </b> By emphasizing the application of computer programming not only in success stories in the software industry but also in familiar scenarios in physical and biological science, engineering, and applied mathematics, <b>Introduction to Programming in Java&nbsp;</b>takes an interdisciplinary approach to teaching programming&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Java&#x2122; programming language.<br> <b> <br> </b> <b>Elements of Programming: </b>Your First Program; Built-in Types of Data; Conditionals and Loops; Arrays; Input and Output. <b>Functions and Modules: </b>Static Methods; Libraries and Clients; Recursion. <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>: Data Types; Creating Data Types; Designing Data Types. <b>Algorithms and Data Structures: </b>Performance; Sorting and Searching; Stacks and Queues; Symbol Tables.<br> <b> <br> </b> For all readers interested in introductory programming courses using the&nbsp;Java programming language.</p><p><b>Robert Sedgewick </b>teaches in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University.

In <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i>, Randy Barnett argues that since the nation's founding, but especially since the 1930s, the courts have been cutting holes in the original Constitution and its amendments to eliminate the parts that protect liberty from the power of government. From the Commerce Clause, to the Necessary and Proper Clause, to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, to the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has rendered each of these provisions toothless. In the process, the written Constitution has been lost.</p><p>Barnett establishes the original meaning of these lost clauses and offers a practical way to restore them to their central role in constraining government: adopting a "presumption of liberty" to give the benefit of the doubt to citizens when laws restrict their rightful exercises of liberty. He also provides a new, realistic and philosophically rigorous theory of constitutional legitimacy that justifies both interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning and, where that meaning is vague or open-ended, construing it so as to better protect the rights retained by the people.</p><p>As clearly argued as it is insightful and provocative, <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i> forcefully disputes the conventional wisdom, posing a powerful challenge to which others must now respond.</p></p><p>2005 Lysander Spooner Award for Advancing the Literature of Liberty, Laissez Faire Books<p>"Step by step, Randy Barnett constructs an intriguing case for a moderately libertarian natural-rights Constitution that allows government action only when, and because, doing so protects the generously defined liberties of each person. Along the way he sheds new light on old controversies. This book should provoke the kind of controversy that advances our understanding of the Constitution."<b>--Mark Tushnet, Georgetown University Law Center, author of<i>The New Constitutional Order</i></b></p><p>"Randy Barnett makes two important arguments, one involving the interpretation of the Constitution by reference to original understandings, the other endorsing a libertarian tilt in resolving disputes about governmental powers. Constitutional scholars and students will find much to admire in Barnett's carefully nuanced arguments, whether or not they ultimately agree with his conclusions. But the book should attract general readers as well. It is remarkably well written, totally devoid of jargon, and presented in a conversational and courteous tone. A truly excellent book!"<b>--Sanford Levinson, University of Texas School of Law, author of<i>Constitutional Faith</i></b></p><p>"Randy Barnett's <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i> is a surprising book. It is surprising that a scholar as learned and competent as Barnett should undertake the defense of libertarianism--a perspective on the state and on law unfashionable among the intelligentsia for a century. It is surprising that he should defend it so well and reasonably. It is even more surprising that such a strong and comprehensive case can be made that this libertarian perspective not only was that of those who wrote and (more importantly) ratified the Constitution, but also that it is the lawful and proper way to interpret the Constitution today. This is an important and challenging book for anyone interested in American law and government."<b>--Charles Fried, Beneficial Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, author of <i>Saying What the Law Is: The Constitution in the Supreme Court</i></b></p><p>"Provocative in the best sense, this is a very readable book whose argument is clear and accessible even to those unversed in the details of constitutional law or theory. It is particularly suggestive and effective in connecting two disparate strands of conservative political and constitutional theory: traditional conservative respect for original constitutional meaning and libertarian commitment to individual rights."<b>--Keith Whittington, author of<i>Constitutional Interpretation: Textual Meaning, Original Intent, and Judicial Review</i></b></p><p>"This is an important book, one that everybody in the field will (or should) take account of. Randy Barnett puts forward a comprehensive, thoughtful, clear, concise, challenging, and historically plausible version of American Constitutionalism.

The environment-centered story is about humans distancing themselves from the rest of nature and searching for a relationship that strikes a balance between constructive and destructive exploitation. The culture-centered story is of how human cultures have become mutually influential and yet mutually differentiating. Both stories have been going on for thousands of years. We do not know whether they will end in triumph or disaster. There is no prospect of covering all of world history in one book. Rather, the fabric of this book is woven from selected strands. Readers will see these at every turn, twisted together into yarn, stretched into stories. Human-focused historical ecology-the environmental theme-will drive readers back, again and again, to the same concepts: sustenance, shelter, disease, energy, technology, art. (The last is a vital category for historians, not only because it is part of our interface with the rest of the world, but also because it forms a record of how we see reality and of how the way we see it changes.) In the global story of human interactions-the cultural theme-we return constantly to the ways people make contact with each another: migration, trade, war, imperialism, pilgrimage, gift exchange, diplomacy, travel-and to their social frameworks: the economic and political arenas, the human groups and groupings, the states and civilizations, the sexes and generations, the classes and clusters of identity.<p>About Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto holds the Principe of Asturias chair of Spanish Civilization at Tufts University where he also directs the Pearson Prentice Hall Seminar Series in Global History.

In <em>The Enigma of Capital</em>, he delivers an impassioned account of how unchecked neoliberalism produced the system-wide crisis that now engulfs the world. <br><br>Beginning in the 1970s, profitability pressures led the capitalist class in advanced countries to shift away from investment in industrial production at home toward the higher returns that financial products promised. Accompanying this was a shift towards privatization, an absolute decline in the bargaining power of labor, and the dispersion of production throughout the developing world. The decades-long and ongoing decline in wages that accompanied this turn produced a dilemma: how can goods--especially real estate--sell at the same rate as before if workers are making less in relative terms? The answer was a huge expansion of credit that fueled the explosive growth of both the financial industry and the real estate market. When one key market collapsed--real estate--the other one did as well, and social devastation resulted. <br><br>Harvey places today's crisis in the broadest possible context: the historical development of global capitalism itself from the industrial era onward. Moving deftly between this history and the unfolding of the current crisis, he concentrates on how such crises both devastate workers and create openings for challenging the system's legitimacy. The battle now will be between the still-powerful forces that want to reconstitute the system of yesterday and those that want to replace it with one that prizes social justice and economic equality. The new afterword focuses on the continuing impact of the crisis and the response to it in 2010.<br><br><strong>One of </strong><strong><em>Huffington Post</em></strong><strong>'s Best Social and Political Awareness Books of 2010</strong><br><br>Winner of the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial Prize for 2010<br><br><strong>Praise for the Hardcover:</strong><br><br>"A lucid and penetrating account of how the power of capital shapes our world."<br>--Andrew Gamble, <em>Independent</em><br><br>"Elegant... entertainingly swashbuckling... Harvey's analysis is interesting not only for the breadth of his scholarship but his recognition of the system's strengths."<br>--John Gapper, <em>Financial Times</em><br></p><p><br><strong>David Harvey</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He is among the top twenty most cited authors in the humanities and is the world's most cited academic geographer. His books include <em>The Limits to Capital, Social Justice and the City</em>, and <em>The Condition of Postmodernity</em>, among many others.<br>"At times of crisis," notes eminent Marxist geographer Harvey (Spaces of Global Capitalism), "the irrationality of capitalism becomes plain for all to see." Harvey excels at a revealing and constructive analysis of global capitalism at a moment when its integration--and the attendant widespread susceptibility to its disruptions and downturns--has never been tighter or the post&#x2013;cold war Western economic model for the world economy more discredited. The narrative delineates with admirable clarity the arcane details of the current financial crisis, while rehearsing the rise of capitalism as a historically specific "process" plagued by fundamental dilemmas. A Marxist perspective comes augmented and nuanced by wide reference to scholarship, close readings of Marx and Engels, and instructive examples of capitalism�s basic tendencies in episodes like Henry Ford�s notorious Fordlandia venture in the Amazon. While certain to be controversial even on the broad left, Harvey�s analysis joins other recent attempts (such as Raj Patel�s The Value of Nothing) to re-think the current economic and political regime from its roots, while identifying and variously championing ready alternatives already manifesting themselves within it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And how did the Gnostic movement influence the development of Christianity in antiquity? Is it true that the Church rejected Gnosticism? This book offers an illuminating discussion of recent scholarly debates over the concept of &#x201c;Gnosticism&#x201d; and the nature of early Christian diversity. Acknowledging that the category &#x201c;Gnosticism&#x201d; is flawed and must be reformed, <b>David Brakke</b> argues for a more careful approach to gathering evidence for the ancient Christian movement known as the Gnostic school of thought. He shows how Gnostic myth and ritual addressed basic human concerns about alienation and meaning, offered a message of salvation in Jesus, and provided a way for people to regain knowledge of God, the ultimate source of their being.</p><p>Rather than depicting the Gnostics as heretics or as the losers in the fight to define Christianity, Brakke argues that the Gnostics participated in an ongoing reinvention of Christianity, in which other Christians not only rejected their ideas but also adapted and transformed them. This book will challenge scholars to think in news ways, but it also provides an accessible introduction to the Gnostics and their fellow early Christians.</p></p><p>David Brakke is Joe R. Engle Chair in the History of Christianity and Professor of History, Ohio State University.&#x201c;Not since Elaine Pagels's ground-breaking and best-selling <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> (1979) has there been a work that communicates so clearly the content and significance of the "Gnostics" for our understanding of early Christian history. The public and the academy need <i>The Gnostics</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Denise Buell, Williams College</b><br><br>&#x201c;A model for how to engage in careful social historical reconstruction.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Davis, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Brakke has a growing reputation for his studies on the history and literature of ancient Christianity, and he moves easily among the sources, making good sense of the sometimes scanty evidence...<i>The Gnostics</i> is a book to be warmly commended to those who have an interest in the development of Christianity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nicholas King, SJ</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps the finest aspect of this book is the way that Brakke successfully nuances the conflict models of early Christian history that remain current in most introductory texts. Rather than merely keying students to the varieties of early Christianity, Brakke introduces beginners to a more open narrative that has emerged recently. This model focuses on the agonistic production of orthodox and heterodox identities through processes of textual production, interpretation, ritual, and so forth. Brakke accomplishes this through a style that is lucid without falling into oversimplification.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J.

He is the author of The Origins of Southern Sharecropping.Edward Royce&#x2019;s Poverty and Power provides a comprehensive look at the reasons why poverty persists in the United States and why it is so often taken for granted by many Americans. Royce's compelling argument identifies the cause of poverty as rooted in inequalities in power and politics and shows the inadequacies of individualistic, cultural, and human capital theories of poverty. (Ellen Reese, University of California, Riverside)<br><br>This updated edition of Poverty and Power remains the single most comprehensive exploration of structural inequality I have ever read. The book brilliantly excoriates our prevailing belief that poverty and inequality result from individuals&#x2019; poor decisions or bad personal attributes. In speaking with colleagues, Poverty and Power has become the &#x2018;go to book&#x2019; for undergraduate and graduate classes that want to examine the economic, cultural, political, and social layers of systemic inequality. (Rick Eckstein, Villanova University)<br><br>Poverty and Power, second edition, is a tour de force treatment of competing perspectives on poverty in America and of the compelling case for understanding poverty as a structurally-generated social problem. This lively and current volume is essential reading for students and citizens interested in developing a more complete understanding of discussions and debates on the nature of poverty and on social policies designed to deal with poverty as a social problem. (Earl Wysong, Indiana University Kokomo)<br><br>Poverty and Power is a well-documented account of the political and economic roots of the exceptionally high rates of poverty in the United States and a systematic critique of explanations that blame the so-called deficiencies of the poor. Its clearly laid out argument and highly readable prose make it an excellent resource for classroom use and for all who are interested in understanding why economic hardship is so widespread in a country of such celebrated wealth. (Alice O'Connor, University of California Santa Barbara)<br><br>In the area of economic inequality, there is no book I would adopt before Poverty and Power. Royce analyzes and synthesizes an astonishing amount of material. I challenge anyone to find a scholar more steeped in the literature on poverty than this author. Poverty and Power will broaden and deepen the knowledge base of any professor (let alone student) but without excessive disciplinary jargon. The result of Royce&#x2019;s painstakingly thorough research and elegant writing is a highly informative yet engaging and readable text. The first edition proved a hit with students in my senior seminar; we eagerly await this second edition! (Lisa M. Tillmann, Rollins College)<br><br>Poverty and Power persuasively demonstrates the force of social structures in generating and perpetuating poverty. Challenging conventional arguments about the poor being poor as a result of their own choices, Royce clearly details how the exercise of power by actors in structurally advantaged positions&#x2014;such as corporate lobbyists, employers, and the media&#x2014;necessitates the existence of poverty. This important work should be required reading for students, scholars, and policy makers.<br> (Monica McDermott, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)<br><br>The United States has a serious poverty problem. As Edward Royce argues with admirable clarity, the causes lie deep in our social structure. Poverty and Power provides a lucid overview of contending theories and a wealth of empirical data. It is an essential antidote to the complacent, blame-the-poor rhetoric that has hamstrung progress toward the elimination of poverty in this country.

In this, his most sociolinguistic work, Goffman relates to certain forms of talk some of the issues that concerned him in his work on frame analysis. This book brings together five of Goffman's essays: "Replies and Responses," "Response Cries," "Footing," "The Lecture," and "Radio Talk."</p><p>Of lasting value in Goffman's work is his insistence that behavior&#x2014;verbal or nonverbal&#x2014;be examined along with the context of that behavior. In all of these classic essays, there is a "topic" at hand for discussion and analysis. In addition, as those familiar with Goffman's work have come to expect, there is the wider context in which the topic can be viewed and related to other topics&#x2014;a characteristic move of Goffman's that has made his work so necessary for students of interaction in many disciplines.</p></p><p>Erving Goffman (1922-1982), Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, was one of the foremost sociologists of the twentieth century.

The book is a poignant, nostalgic evocation of Kashmir, Ali's homeland, with a special emphasis on the events since 1990 when Kashmir rebelled against Indian rule. At the center of this devastation, with "mass rapes in the villages/ towns left in cinders," is the desecration in 1995 of the shrine of Sheikh Noor-ud-Din, the patron saint of Kashmir. This Hindu-Moslem conflict reminds Ali of similar genocidal wars in Bosnia and Armenia. But in Kashmir the blood of victims falls like "rubies/ on Himalayan snow" while "guns shoot stars into the sky." Kashmiri myth and culture hang like a tapestry around the poems, dramatizing the importance of saffron, paisley, the Shalimar Gardens and the ghazal (folk songs). Ali also alludes to Tacitus, Yeats, Dickinson, Shakespeare, and Eliot. With the population decimated and the post office destroyed, Ali's poems become "cries like dead letters," and the poet becomes "keeper of the minaret." Essential for all large collections.?Daniel L.

Scott Peck explains the ideas that shaped this book and that continue to influence an ever-growing audience of readers. <br> Written in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, <i>The Road Less Traveled</i> continues to enable us to explore the nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us determine how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one's own true self. <br> Recognizing that -- in the famous opening line of his book -- "Life is difficult" and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather gently guides them through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding. <br> Combining profound psychological insight and deep spirituality, this one-of-a-kind hardcover anniversary edition is a book to treasure and turn to again and again for inspiration and understanding. As Phyllis Theroux wrote in <i>The Washington Post</i> when the original edition of <i>The Road Less Traveled</i> was first published, "It is not just a book but a spontaneous act of generosity."</p><p>By melding love, science, and religion into a primer on personal growth, M. Scott Peck launched his highly successful writing and lecturing career with this book. Even to this day, Peck remains at the forefront of spiritual psychology as a result of <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>. In the era of <i>I'm OK, You're OK</i>, Peck was courageous enough to suggest that "life is difficult" and personal growth is a "complex, arduous and lifelong task." His willingness to expose his own life stories as well as to share the intimate stories of his anonymous therapy clients creates a compelling and heartfelt narrative.M. Scott Peck, M.D. is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>, with six million copies in print. His other books include <i>Further Along the Road Less Traveled, The Road Less Traveled</i> and <i>Beyond, Meditations from the Road and Golf and the Spirit</i>.</p><h2>Beyond Objecthood: The Exhibition as a Critical Form since 1968 (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The rise of the exhibition as critical form and artistic medium, from Robert Smithson's antimodernist non-sites in 1968 to today's institutional gravitation toward the participatory.</b></p><p>In 1968, Robert Smithson reacted to Michael Fried's influential essay &#x201c;Art and Objecthood&#x201d; with a series of works called non-sites. While Fried described the spectator's connection with a work of art as a momentary visual engagement, Smithson's non-sites asked spectators to do something more: to take time looking, walking, seeing, reading, and thinking about the combination of objects, images, and texts installed in a gallery. In <i>Beyond Objecthood</i>, James Voorhies traces a genealogy of spectatorship through the rise of the exhibition as a critical form&#x2015;and artistic medium. Artists like Smithson, Group Material, and Michael Asher sought to reconfigure and expand the exhibition and the museum into something more active, open, and democratic, by inviting spectators into new and unexpected encounters with works of art and institutions. This practice was sharply critical of the ingrained characteristics long associated with art institutions and conventional exhibition-making; and yet, Voorhies finds, over time the critique has been diluted by efforts of the very institutions that now gravitate to the &#x201c;participatory.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Beyond Objecthood</i> focuses on innovative figures, artworks, and institutions that pioneered the exhibition as a critical form, tracing its evolution through the activities of curator Harald Szeemann, relational art, and New Institutionalism. Voorhies examines recent artistic and curatorial work by Liam Gillick, Thomas Hirschhorn, Carsten H�ller, Maria Lind, Apolonija &#x160;u&#x161;ter&#x161;ic, and others, at such institutions as Documenta, e-flux, Manifesta, and Office for Contemporary Art Norway, and he considers the continued potential of the exhibition as a critical form in a time when the differences between art and entertainment increasingly blur.</p></p><p>James Voorhies is a curator and art historian of modern and contemporary art. He is Dean of Fine Arts and Associate Professor at California College of the Arts in San Francisco.<p>An exceptional book bridging exhibition histories, curatorial research, and contemporary practice rather than giving in to the strained rhetorics of their accompanying discourses. Voorhies brings us up to date with the evolution of the curatorial and its numerous exhibition forms over the last twenty years or so. Like Voorhies's own practice, it draws expertly upon a deep understanding of the entanglement of curatorial research and artistic practice, their educational remit and their multiple exhibition forms, discursive sites, experiences, and contestations.</p>&#x2015;<b>Paul O'Neill</b>, Director of the Graduate Program, Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College; author of <i>The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s)</i><br><br><p>James Voorhies narrates major public moments for Western art of the past fifty years, while positing a trajectory from Michael Fried's modernist fear of objecthood to a more contemporary politics of aesthetics after Jacques Ranci�re. Refreshingly open in its understanding of what might constitute an exhibition, this timely book should be celebrated for defending the potential for criticality arising across myriad forms.</p>&#x2015;<b>Lucy Steeds</b>, Senior Research Fellow for Afterall at Central Saint Martins (University of the Arts London); editor of <i>Exhibition</i><br><br><p>In <i>Beyond Objecthood</i>, Voorhies provides a clearly structured account of the evolution of context as the base of our aesthetic and political encounters with contemporary art. His account draws much-needed attention to the ways in which institutional habits and frames determine meaning in our encounter with an art object, and how key artists unsettle these habits to invoke critical power beyond the reach of much so-called 'political art'.</p>&#x2015;<b>Catherine Wood</b>, Senior Curator, International Art (Performance) Tate Modern, London<br><br><p>Although the history of art is centuries old, barely a book could be found just a few decades ago that treated that uncollectable, ephemeral thing called 'the exhibition'&#x2015;as opposed to the art object itself. The breadth of that still comparatively new history is being amended with a number of new publications that probe exhibitions as critical forms. James Voorhies's study sits squarely among these, tackling an impressive range of exhibitions, art projects, and discursive structures from 1968 to the present. He invites readers to see that what lies around and indeed beyond the object might nevertheless be at the very center of its comprehension.</p>&#x2015;<b>Elena Filipovic</b>, Director and Chief Curator, Kunsthalle Basel; author of <i>The Apparently Marginal Activities of Marcel Duchamp</i><br><br><p>In <i>Beyond Objecthood</i>, James Voorhies offers a case study not only of the evolution of exhibitions as objects, but also of the role of any critical apparatus in relation to them.

Tennessee Williams called her "the most important writer of&nbsp;prose fiction in modern American letters"; for John Ashbery she was "one of the&nbsp;finest modern writers of fiction in any language." Now, on the occasion of her&nbsp;centenary, Library of America presents the most complete edition ever published&nbsp;of Bowles's incomparable fiction, along with an extensive selection of her frank,&nbsp;vivid, and funny letters. <i>Two Serious Ladies</i> (1943), based partly on her&nbsp;honeymoon in Mexico with her husband, the writer and composer Paul Bowles,&nbsp;follows two bourgeois American women in Panama as they jettison sexual and&nbsp;cultural norms in search of happiness: Christina Goering, a wealthy spinster who&nbsp;becomes a high-class prostitute; and newlywed Frieda Copperfield, who finds love&nbsp;and comfort in the arms of a young Panamanian girl. <i>In The Summer House </i>(1954),&nbsp;a play about two mothers, one selfish and ruthless, despising her dreamy&nbsp;daughter, the other gentle, dominated by her strong-minded daughter, was&nbsp;performed on Broadway in 1953 and reflects Bowles's complicated relationship&nbsp;with her own mother. The volume also includes five short stories, two song lyrics,&nbsp;a puppet play, and the nonfiction sketch "East Side: North Africa." (Paul Bowles's&nbsp;rewrite of "East Side: North Africa," published in 1966, under Jane's name, as the&nbsp;short story "Everything Is Nice," is also included as an appendix), as well as&nbsp;fragments from two abandoned novels, a section of Two Serious Ladies cut from&nbsp;an earlier draft, four abandoned stories, one unfinished play, and one&nbsp;autobiographical fragment. Rounding out the volume are 133 letters, including&nbsp;candid portraits of such friends and acquaintances as John Ashbery, William&nbsp;Burroughs, Ira Gershwin, Allen Ginsberg, Carson McCullers, Sylvia Plath, Paul&nbsp;Robeson, Susan Sontag, Gertrude Stein, Gore Vidal, Eudora Welty, and Tennessee&nbsp;Williams.

It uses &#34;great cases&#34; for learning the major issues in constitutional law, and it gives less attention to small ripples of contemporary doctrine. It emphasizes the task of interpretation, including many examples of the interpretation of the Constitution by the political branches. And it includes features of our constitutional history that are neglected in many casebooks, such as slavery, the amendment process, and the early history of the freedom of speech. The third edition has many refinements. It also has more coverage of executive discretion, the taxing and spending powers, the Necessary and Proper Clause, incorporation, and the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is now suitable not only for a survey course, but also for a course focused on federalism, on the First Amendment, or on the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p></p><h2>Financial Reporting and Analysis</h2><p><b>For the first time, Revsine's <i>Financial Reporting &amp; Analysis </i> will feature Connect, the premier digital teaching and learning tool that allows instructors to assign and assess course material.</b><br>Financial Reporting &amp; Analysis (FR&amp;A) by Revsine/Collins/Johnson/Mittelstaedt emphasizes both the process of financial reporting and the analysis of financial statements.

To her reading of the familiar story of the Israelites and their flight from slavery in Egypt, Avivah Zornberg has brought a vast range of classical Jewish interpretations and Midrashic sources, literary allusions, and ideas from philosophy and psychology. Her quest in this book, as she writes in the introduction, is "to find those who will hear with me a particular idiom of redemption," who will hear "within the particulars of rapture . . . what cannot be expressed."<br><br>Zornberg's previous book, <b>The Beginning of Desire</b>:<b> Reflections on Genesis</b>, won the National Jewish Book Award for nonfiction in 1995 and has become a classic among readers of all religions. <b>The Particulars of Rapture</b> will enhance Zornberg's reputation as one of today's most original and compelling interpreters of the biblical and rabbinic traditions.</p><p><i>The Particulars of Rapture</i> is Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg's literary and theological exploration of the book of Exodus. Zornberg, the daughter of a rabbi, is a scholar of English literature who has become a popular teacher of religion in Israel, North America, and England. Her approach to Exodus is midrashic--a rabbinic tradition of creative, interpretive, even fanciful study of the Bible that often involves "the telling of stories that fill in gaps in the written biblical text." <i>The Particulars of Rapture</i> gathers many such stories that Zornberg has told and also discusses the process by which she created these stories--a process that she describes with reference to a wide range of psychological, philosophical, and literary works. If this all sounds complicated, that's because it is. "In my approach," she explains, "the biblical text is not allowed to stand alone, but has its boundaries blurred by later commentaries and by a persistent intertextuality that makes it impossible to imagine that meaning is somehow transparently present in the isolated text." She imagines interpretation to be <i>part of</i> the text itself, and not a second- order process that is derived from the text. It's a wise and receptive way of reading, and those willing to follow Zornberg's sometimes knotty prose will find, from time to time, clear bright observations about the way believers continue to experience Israel's slavery, freedom, and redemption even today. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Praise for Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg's <b>The Beginning of Desire</b>:<br><br>"A sinewy, powerful, and hauntingly beautiful reanimation of the ancient texts of early Israel and of their heroes and heroines."<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i>"A wonderful book."<br>-<i>Time<br></i><br>"We should not believe that it is no longer possible to create sacred literature.

The projects are graded as beginner, intermediate and advanced, but 'beginner' should be interpreted as someone who has previous experience with origami or a strong interest in learning about it, because even the simplest projects include a lot of steps and demand precise folding. But for someone who enjoys doing origami and wants to try some complex projects, the directions are very clear and the photographs of the finished work should serve as an inspiration.&nbsp;<br>&#x2015;Sarah Boslaugh, MAA Online, June 2009</p> <p>Gjerde&#x2019;s [book] is as much an art book and is a feast for the eyes on every page . . . It is not standard origami, nor indeed standard tessellation. It takes tessellations into three dimensions and then back into two . . . All pieces are from a single piece of paper, prefolded into the grids.

Lilienthal Book)</h2><p>In the early part of this century, the discovery of a walled-up cave in northwest China led to the retrieval of a lost early Ch'an (Zen) literature of the T'ang dynasty (618-907). One of the recovered Zen texts was a seven-piece collection, the <i>Bodhidharma Anthology</i>. Of the numerous texts attributed to Bodhidharma, this anthology is the only one generally believed to contain authentic Bodhidharma material.<br><br>Jeffrey L. Broughton provides a reliable annotated translation of the <i>Bodhidharma Anthology</i> along with a detailed study of its nature, content, and background. His work is especially important for its rendering of the three Records, which contain some of the earliest Zen dialogues and constitute the real beginnings of Zen literature.<br><br>The vivid dialogues and sayings of Master Yuan, a long-forgotten member of the Bodhidharma circle, are the hallmark of the <i>Records</i>. Master Yuan consistently criticizes reliance on the Dharma, on teachers, on meditative practice, and on scripture, all of which lead to self-deception and confusion, he says. According to Master Yuan, if one has spirit and does not seek anything, including the teachings of Buddhism, then one will attain the quietude of liberation. The boldness in Yuan's utterances prefigures much of the full-blown Zen tradition we recognize today.<br><br>Broughton utilizes a Tibetan translation of the <i>Bodhidharma Anthology </i>as an informative gloss on the Chinese original. Placing the anthology within the context of the Tun-huang Zen manuscripts as a whole, he proposes a new approach to the study of Zen, one that concentrates on literary history, a genealogy of texts rather than the usual genealogy of masters.</p><p>His name comes up in mentions of Zen's misty past, but without any writings or authentication, modern authors have often referred to Bodhidharma as semilegendary. In 1935, D.T. Suzuki had rummaged through a number of newly discovered Zen texts dating back over a thousand years, but not until recently did scholars agree that some may contain the words of Bodhidharma himself. Now Jeffrey Broughton has brushed off the dust for the English reading world. In question-and-answer style anticipating later Zen classics like the <i>Lin-Chi Lu</i> (<i>Zen Teachings of Master Lin-Chi</i>), Bodhidharma fields questions from his students on dharma, the mind, and reality. Vintage Zen iconoclasm permeates every line as dharmas are dispensed with and scriptures shot down. A rock painted with a Buddhist image is still just a rock. Just so, reality is just reality. A previously unknown student of Bodhidharma, one Master Yuan, shows himself to be a worthy adept, equal to the more well-known Hui-kuo, who also appears. The actual Bodhidharma texts are quite brief, with the bulk of this work consisting of Broughton's scholarly introduction, commentary, appendices, and translations of related finds. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>&#34;These original documents are crucial for understanding East Asian Buddhist development. Professor Broughton&#39;s analysis of the material provides a new and refreshing look at the tradition which was focused on meditation and the ancient lineage of Bodhidharma. . . . We can be grateful that the translations are accompanied by a detailed study that gives the reader access to the social and cultural events of the time.&#34; (Lewis Lancaster, University of California, Berkeley)</p><h2>I Love Artists: New and Selected Poems (Volume 18) (New California Poetry)</h2><p>Drawing on four decades of work and including new poems published here for the first time, this selection of Mei-mei Berssenbrugge&#x2019;s poetry displays the extraordinary luminosity characteristic of her style&#x2015;its delicate, meticulous observation, great scenic imagination, and unusual degree of comfort with states of indetermination, contingency, and flux.</p><p><b>Mei-mei Berssenbrugge</b> was born in Beijing and lives in New Mexico. She is the author of nine volumes of poetry, including <i>Nest, The Four Year Old Girl,</i> and <i>Empathy</i>.Over the past quarter century, Berssenbrugge has released her work solely in small press editions, many of which are now out of print. This collection serves as a worthy introduction to her elegant oeuvre, but does not take the place of a collection, particularly because Berssenbrugge tends to work long, and some of what is here is excerpted. There are nine poems total from her first three books, of which the 10-part "The Heat Bird," from the book of the same title (1983), serves as a kind of turning point into Berssenbrugge's first major work, <i>Empathy</i> (1989), half of which is reprinted here. Berssenbrugge writes what might be called proofs, working sensuously off the language of science to find the divides between elements over which one has control and those over which one does not, "a constant notation of parallel streams of thought and observation." Though all three are represented, excerpts from two of her Kelsey Street Editions releases, <i>Four Year Old Girl</i> (1998) and <i>Nest</i> (2003), should send readers to those beautifully produced volumes. The four new poems are the book's weakest, but seem transitional. ("Even if a detail resists all significance or function, it's not useless, precisely," notes the title work.)

For anyone interested in algebra and trigonometry.</p><p><p><b>To the Instructor</b></p> <p> As a professor at an urban public university for over 30 years, I am aware of the varied needs of algebra and trigonometry students who range from having little mathematical background and a fear of mathematics courses to those who have had a strong mathematical education and are highly motivated. For some of your students, this will be their last course in mathematics, while others may decide to further their mathematical education. I have written this text for both groups. As the author of precalculus, engineering calculus, finite math and business calculus texts, and, as a teacher, I understand what students must know if they are to be focused and successful in upper level mathematics courses. However, as a father of four college graduates, I also understand the realities of college life. I have taken great pains to insure that the text contains solid, student-friendly examples and problems, as well as a clear, seamless, writing style. I encourage you to share with me your experiences teaching from this text. </p> <p><b>THE SIXTH EDITION</b></p> <p> The Sixth Edition builds upon a solid foundation by integrating new features and techniques that further enhance student interest and involvement. The elements of previous editions that have proved successful remain, while many changes, some obvious, others subtle, have been made. A huge benefit of authoring a successful series is the broad-based feedback upon which improvements and additions are ultimately based. Virtually every change to this edition is the result of thoughtful comments and suggestions made from colleagues and students who have used previous editions. I am sincerely grateful for this feedback and have tried to make changes that improve the flow and usability of the text. </p> <p><b>NEW TO THE SIXTH EDITION</b></p> <p> <b>Real Mathematics at Motorola</b> </p> <p> Each chapter begins with Field Trip to Motorola, a brief description of a current situation at Motorola, followed by Interview at Motorola, a biographical sketch of a Motorola employee. At the end of each chapter is Project at Motorola, written by the Motorola employee, that contains a description, with exercises, of a problem at Motorola that relates to the mathematics found in the chapter. It doesn't get more REAL than this. </p> <p> <b>Preparing for This Section</b> </p> <p> Most sections now open with a referenced list (by section and page number) of key items to review in preparation for the section ahead. This provides a just-in-time review for students. </p> <p> <b>Chapter R Review</b> </p> <p> This chapter, a revision of the old Chapter 1, has been renamed to more accurately reflect its content. It may be used as the first part of the course or as a just-in-time review when the content is required in a later chapter. Specific references to this chapter occur throughout the book to assist in the review process. </p> <p> <b>Content</b> </p> <ul> <li>The Appendix, Graphing Utilities, has been updated and expanded to include the latest features of the graphing calculator. While the graphing calculator remains an option, identified by a graphing icon, references to the Appendix occur at appropriate places in the text for those inclined to use the graphing calculator features of the text.</li> <li>The Area of a Sector is now included as part of the section Angles and Their Measure.</li> <li>A discussion of combining waves was added to the section on Harmonic Motion.</li> </ul> <p><b>Organization</b></p> <ul> <li>The discussion on Rational Functions now appears in two sections, Rational Functions I and Rational Functions II: Analyzing Graphs. This division should allow the sections to be covered in one teaching period each.</li> <li>The discussion of Polynomial and Rational Inequalities now appears after Polynomial and Rational Functions. This allows us to use information obtained about the graphs to solve the inequalities. Students and instructors will appreciate how easy this usually tough concept is now handled.</li> <li>Zeros of a Polynomial Function now appears in a separate chapter following Polynomial and Rational Functions to provide more flexibility in teaching and testing.</li> <li>The chapter on Trigonometric Functions now has a single section devoted to the graphs of the sine and cosine functions, including a discussion of sinusoidal graphs. Separate sections follow on Graphs of the Remaining Trigonometric Functions and Phase Shift; Sinusoidal Curve Fitting. These changes will allow the material of each section to be taught in a single period and provide flexibility in choice of content.</li> <li>The chapter on Analytic Trigonometry now begins with two sections that discuss the inverse trigonometric functions. The chapter concludes with two sections devoted to Trigonometric Equations. These changes will allow each section to be taught in a single period.</li> <li>Separate chapters on Sequences; Induction; the Binomial Theorem and Counting and Probability also provide more flexibility in coverage.</li> </ul> <p><b>FEATURES IN THE 6TH EDITION</b></p> <ul> <li>Section <b><i>OBJECTIVES</i></b> appear in a numbered list to begin each section.</li> <li><i>NOW WORK PROBLEM XX</i> appears after a concept has been introduced. This directs the student to a problem in the exercises that tests the concept, insuring that the concept has been mastered before moving on. The Now Work problems are identified in the exercises using yellow numbers and a pencil icon.</li> <li>Optional Comments, Explorations, Seeing the Concept, Examples, and Exercises that utilize the graphing calculator are clearly marked with a calculator icon. Calculator exercises are also identified by the icon and green numbers.</li> <li>References to Calculus are identified by a calculus icon.</li> <li>Historical Perspectives, sometimes with exercises, are presented in context and provide interesting anecdotal information.</li> <li>Varied applications are abundant both in Examples and in Exercises. Many contain sourced data.</li> <li>Discussion, Writing, and Research problems appear in each exercise set, identified by an icon and red numbers. These provide the basis for class discussion, writing projects, and collaborative learning experiences.</li> <li>An extensive Chapter Review provides a list of important formulas, definitions, theorems, and objectives, as well as a complete set of Review Exercises, with sample test questions identified by blue numbers.</li> </ul> <p><b>USING THE 6TH EDITION EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY WITH YOUR SYLLABUS</b></p> <p> To meet the varied needs of diverse syllabi, this book contains more content than expected in a college algebra course. This book has been organized with flexibility of use in mind. Even within a given chapter, certain sections can be skipped without fear of future problems. </p> <p> <b>Chapter R - Review</b> </p> <p> This chapter, a revision of the old Chapter 1, has been renamed to more accurately reflect its content. It may be used as the first part of the course or as a just-in-time review when the content is required in a later chapter. Specific references to this chapter occur throughout the book to assist in the review process. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 1 - Equations and Inequalities</b> </p> <p> Primarily a review of Intermediate Algebra topics, this material is prerequisite for later topics. For those who prefer to treat complex numbers and negative discriminants early, Section 5.3 can be covered at any time after Section 1.3. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 2 - Graphs</b> </p> <p> This chapter lays the foundation. Sections 2.5 and 2.6 may be skipped without adverse effects. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 3 - Functions and Their Graphs</b> </p> <p> Perhaps the most important chapter. Section 3.6 can be skipped without adverse effects. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 4 - Polynomial and Rational Functions</b> </p> <p> Topic selection is dependent on your syllabus. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 5 - The Zeros of a Polynomial Function</b> </p> <p> Topic selection is dependent on your syllabus. Section 5.1 is not absolutely necessary, but its coverage makes some computations easier. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 6 - Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</b> </p> <p> Sections 6.1-6.5 follow in sequence; Sections 6.6, 6.7, and 6.8 each require Section 6.3. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 7 - Trigonometric Functions</b> </p> <p> The sections follow in sequence. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 8 - Analytic Trigonometry</b> </p> <p> The sections follow in sequence. Sections 8.2, 8.6, and 8.8 may be skipped in a brief course. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 9 Application Trigonometric</b> </p> <p> The sections follow in sequence. Sections 9.4 and 9.5 may be skipped in a brief course. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 10 - Polar Coordinates; Vectors</b> </p> <p> Sections 10.1-10.3 and Sections 10.4-10.5 are independent and may be covered separately or in sequence, depending on the course syllabus. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 11 - Analytic Geometry</b> </p> <p> Sections 11.1-11.4 follow in sequence. Sections 11.5,11.6, and 11.7 are independent of each other, but do depend on Sections 11.1-11.4. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 12 - Systems of Equations and Inequalities</b> </p> <p> Sections 12.1-12.2 follow in sequence; Sections 12.3-12.8 require Sections 12.1 and 12.2, and may be covered in any order. Section 12.9 depends on Section 12.8. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 13 - Sequences; Induction; the Binomial Theorem</b> </p> <p> There are three independent parts: Sections 13.1-13.3,13.4, and 13.5. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 14 - Counting and Probability</b> </p> <p> Sections 14.1-14.3 follow in order. </p> <p><b>To the Student</b></p> <p> As you begin your study of Algebra and Trigonometry you may feel overwhelmed by the number of theorems, definitions, procedures, and equations that confront you. You may even wonder whether or not you can learn all of this material in the time allotted. These concerns are normal. Keep in mind that many elements of Algebra and Trigonometry are all around us as we go through our daily routines. Many of the concepts you will learn to express mathematically, you already know intuitively. For many of you, this may be your last math course, while for others, just the first in a series of many. Either way, this text was written with you in mind. I have taught algebra and trigonometry courses for over thirty years. I am also the father of four college students who called home from time to time, frustrated and with questions. I know what you're going through. So I have written a text that doesn't overwhelm, or unnecessarily complicate Algebra and Trigonometry, but at the same time it gives you the skills and practice you need to be successful. </p> <p> This text is designed to help you, the student, master the terminology and basic concepts of Algebra and Trigonometry. These aims have helped to shape every aspect of the book. Many learning aids are built into the format of the text to make your study of the material easier and more rewarding. This book is meant to be a "machine for learning," one that can help you focus your efforts and get the most from the time and energy you invest. </p> <p><b>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY</b></p> <p> First, and most important, this book is meant to be read-so please, begin by reading the material assigned. You will find that the text has additional explanation and examples that will help you. Also, it is best to read the section before the lecture, so you can ask questions right away about anything you didn't understand. </p> <p> Many sections begin with "Preparing for This Section," a list of concepts that will be used in the section. Take the short amount of time required to refresh your memory. This will make the section easier to understand and will actually save you time and effort. </p> <p> A list of <b><i>OBJECTIVES</i></b> is provided at the beginning of each section. Read them. They will help you recognize the important ideas and skills developed in the section. </p> <p> After a concept has been introduced and an example given, you will see <i>NOW WORK PROBLEM XX.</i> Go to the exercises at the end of the section, work the problem cited, and check your answer in the back of the book. If you get it right, you can be confident in continuing on in the section. If you don't get it right, go back over the explanations and examples to see what you might have missed. Then rework the problem. Ask for help if you miss it again. </p> <p> If you follow these practices throughout the section, you will find that you have probably done many of your homework problems. In the exercises, every "Now Work Problem" number is in yellow with a pencil icon. All the odd-numbered problems have answers in the back of the book and worked-out solutions in the Student Solutions Manual supplement. Be sure you have made an honest effort before looking at a worked-out solution. </p> <p> At the end of each chapter is a Chapter Review. Use it to be sure you are completely familiar with the equations and formulas listed under "Things to Know." If you are unsure of an item here, use the page reference to go back and review it. Go through the Objectives and be sure you can answer "Yes" to the question "I should be able to...." If you are uncertain, a page reference to the objective is provided. </p> <p> Spend the few minutes necessary to answer the "Fill-in-the-Blank" items and the "True/False" items. These are quick and valuable questions to answer. </p> <p> Lastly, do the problems identified with blue numbers in the Review Exercises. These are my suggestions for a Practice Test. Do some of the other problems in the review for more practice to prepare for your exam. </p> <p> Please do not hesitate to contact me, through Prentice Hall, with any suggestions or comments that would improve this text. I look forward to hearing from you. </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p> <p> Textbooks are written by authors, but evolve from an idea into final form through the efforts of many people.

For each body system, broad coverage of anatomy, physiology, pathology, diagnostic procedures, treatment procedures, and pharmacology is provided. The author emphasizes both terms built from Latin and Greek word parts, and modern English terms, helping students develop a full working word part vocabulary they can use to interpret any new term. This edition contains many new terms, and has been reorganized for more efficient learning. To eliminate confusion, Word Building tables have been removed from each chapter and the terms have been distributed throughout the pathology, diagnostic procedure, and treatment procedure tables, where they are more immediately relevant to students. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>Note: This ISBN is just the standalone book, if the customer wants the book/access card order the ISBN below;</p> </b> <p> <br> <b>133962032 / 9780133962031 Medical Terminology: A Living Language PLUS MyMedicalTerminologyLab with Pearson etext -- Access Card Package </b> </p> <p> <b> <br>Package consists of:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>0132843471 / 9780132843478 Medical Terminology: A Living Language <br>0133936236 / 9780133936230 MyMedicalTerminologyLab with Pearson etext - Access Card - Medical Terminology A Living Language<br> </b></p><b> </b></p><p>Bonnie F.

She writes an exhaustive lament for mothers of the "dark magicians," and revisits the devastating murder of Emmett Till. These dynamic sequences serve as a backdrop for present-day racial calamities and calls for resistance. Smith embraces elaborate and eloquent language&#x2014; "<i>her gorgeous fallen son a horrid hidden / rot. Her tiny hand starts crushing roses&#x2014;one by one / by one she wrecks the casket&#x2019;s spray. It&#x2019;s how she / mourns&#x2014;a mother, still, despite the roar of thorns"</i>&#x2014; as she sharpens her unerring focus on incidents of national mayhem and mourning. Smith envisions, reenvisions, and ultimately reinvents the role of witness with an incendiary fusion of forms, including prose poems, ghazals, sestinas, and sonnets. With poems impossible to turn away from, one of America&#x2019;s most electrifying writers reveals what is frightening, and what is revelatory, about history.</p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>PATRICIA SMITH</b>&nbsp;is a National Book Award finalist (2008) and the author of six critically acknowledged volumes of poetry. Her awards and honors include the 2014 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize from the Library of Congress, the 2013 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets, and a 2013 Phillis Wheatley Book Award. A formidable performer, Smith has read her work at venues all over the United States and around the world. She is a Cave Canem faculty member, an associate professor of English at CUNY/College of Staten Island, and a faculty member in the Sierra Nevada College M.F.A. program.<p>"Smith exhibits razor-sharp linguistic sensibilities that give her scenes a cinematic flair and her lines a momentum that buoys their emotional weight. This is best captured in 'Elegy,' a stunning, long-lined poem about her thick-as-thieves relationship with her father, who found it difficult to be his wife&#x2019;s 'sky and root.' Smith&#x2019;s urgent collection lives up to its title, burning bright and urgent as a bonfire." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Patricia Smith&#x2019;s moving collection of elegies combines the act of witness with the delights of lyric poetry, intervening with master narratives of history, or sociology, to rescue the suffering subject. The rich sonic texture of the work enables the subtle modulations of mordant wit, anger, and grief throughout the collection, where feeling is tuned by assonance and consonance.&#x201d; &#x2014;Averill Curdy, editor, <i>The Longman Anthology of Poetry</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Incendiary Art</i> is the fire this time. An epic in five movements where history becomes tragedy, becomes farce, becomes fable. Where the reader becomes complicit, where outcomes burn into forgotten memories, and where nobody gets off the hook.&#x201d; &#x2014;Marlon James</p>&nbsp;<br><br><p>&#x201c;As with Smith&#x2019;s previous books, one encounters an urgent voice on the page that is exuberant, sharp, and questing in its search for understanding of the fatalities that besiege black life in America. The imaginative qualities of these poems and others are what make them captivating. She is a poet of immense originality, and these poems are a testament to her powers.&#x201d; &#x2014;Major Jackson, author of <i>Roll Deep </i>and <i>Leaving Saturn: Poems</i><br><br> &#x201c;Patricia Smith is a masterful poet, performer, and pundit. And while her chosen field is the form and grace of language, her gift to the world that orbits the Black experience is truth. This truth contains three extraordinary moments: (1) she conceives history in a way that deftly removes the chaff of lies; (2) seeing this history we know, or at least have the possibility of knowing, who and what we are; and (3) by taking us beyond America&#x2019;s ahistorical tendencies the book gives us, many for the first time, a chance to imagine a future that includes our flaws and our potentials, all the while balancing the accounts of tragedy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Walter Mosley<br><br> "A <i><i>tour de force</i></i> at double the length of an expected poetry volume, <i><i>Incendiary Art</i></i>is bound to be one of this year&#x2019;s most vital and devastating books, where Smith&#x2019;s historical sweep, moral invective, and lyrical mastery speak truth to power and render these trying times unflinchingly... These stirring poems will make any reader shudder, weep, and strive for an America that finally regards all of its citizens, to borrow Malcolm X&#x2019;s phrase, as righteous human beings." &#x2014;<i>Plume</i></p>"Smith... creates 'incendiary art,' and never have her meticulously structured and fully fueled poems been more scorching than in this acutely visceral, empathetically inhabited, and intimately detailed collection. Smith investigates with excruciating sensitivity and strange beauty the drowning of two baby black girls by their black fathers, accidental street shootings of the innocent, and police shootings of unarmed African Americans. With her latest heroically unflinching poems of incandescent clarity, Smith joins Angela Jackson and Claudia Rankine in the tragically growing chorus of poets decrying racial violence."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;<br><br>"Patricia is one of the poets writing today that I most deeply admire. Her work is always timely, powerful, necessary, and at turns heartbreaking."<br> &#x2014;Natasha Trethewey, author of <i>Thrall: Poems</i><br><br> "It&#x2019;s a book of violence, outrage, grief, despair, a book about racism, that generalization we never stop packing with the lives that we destroy... a book of terrible beauty, opulent brutality, immersed in the contradictions that kindle in and around and in reaction to black lives and deaths. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine art changing anything the book describes&#x2014;hard to imagine it forestalling the next of these murders or undermining the state&#x2019;s ability to explain away the next all-too-explainable killing of someone young and brown&#x2014;but that impossibility makes these poems more compelling...<i>" </i>&#x2014;<i>The Kenyon Review </i><br><br> "Smith's new book is possibly her best work to date."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The Millions</i></p><h2>wd~50: The Cookbook</h2><p><p><strong>The first cookbook from one of the world&#x2019;s most groundbreaking chefs and a&nbsp;pioneering restaurant on the Lower East Side&#x2014;the story of Wylie&nbsp;Dufresne&#x2019;s&nbsp;wd~50&nbsp;and the dishes that made it famous</strong></p><p><br>When it opened in 2003, wd~50 was New York&#x2019;s most innovative,&nbsp;cutting-edge&nbsp;restaurant.

We load our shopping baskets with this bounty from all over the world. And then what? We certainly enjoy eating the fresh produce. But deep within most of us lurks a desire to preserve these flavors for future enjoyment. </p><p> Many of us remember our grandmothers spending long hours in the summer preserving the produce from their large gardens. While few of us have a desire to return to the era of preserving large quantities of food for the cold months, we are developing a taste for new flavors and want to use them to enhance an otherwise simple meal. A flavorful bit of chutney, a rich salsa, a crisp pickle, a special sauce, or a flavored oil or vinegar adds interest to a meal while fitting a healthy lifestyle. Jams, conserves, marmalades and jellies can be spread on toast, English muffins or tea biscuits with no added butter necessary. </p><p> Throughout this book we offer recipes for smaller rather than larger finished amounts. A small yield gives more opportunity to make several different preserves. It also reduces the risk of scorching that is always a danger when cooking larger batches. And it makes large storage areas unnecessary. Most recipes can be made year round and, most important, at your convenience. </p><p> Preserving food is great fun and not at all difficult. When you decide to preserve food, there are two important things you must do. The first is to destroy all micro-organisms such as bacteria, molds and yeasts naturally present in food to prevent them from spoiling the preserved product. Having done this, the second thing is to make sure your preserving containers are sealed in such a way that other organisms cannot enter, otherwise they will cause your carefully prepared food to spoil. </p><p> Micro-organisms and enzymes naturally present in foods cause many changes to occur. Not all of these changes are bad. Many micro-organisms -- bacteria, molds and yeasts -- are intentionally used to create new forms of foods. For instance, bacteria added to milk produce creamy yogurt. Enzymes turn milk into curds, and molds introduced into the curds create wonderful cheeses. Winemakers know the result of yeasts growing in grape juice. However, not all organisms cause changes that are desirable. They can cause food to spoil. </p><p> Today's methods of preserving are much easier, thanks to innovations from jar manufacturers. The two-piece closures, are much more foolproof than were the glass-topped sealer jars used in bygone days. And modern jars come in a variety of convenient sizes that let us preserve small amounts quickly without overwhelming our storage areas. The small batches featured in our book let you make a small amount of a tasty preserve in very short order. </p><p> We now have access to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables -- some of which were unknown to North America until recently. Many of these fruits and vegetables, such as mangoes, papayas, fresh figs and even strawberries and a variety of peppers are now available year round. Almost all of our recipes can be made throughout the year with this greater availability. However, a few foods are only available for short times of the year. Seville oranges are a good example. They are usually in stores only in January and February. Other fruits and vegetables, although available throughout the year, may be of better quality at certain times. We believe the quality of our own locally grown produce is superior since it arrives fresh in our kitchens without extended storage. At other times, good imported produce is available -- just remember, you may be paying more. Preserve when the quality is finest and price is lowest. </p><p></p></p><h2>The Heroic Slave: A Cultural and Critical Edition</h2><p>First published nearly a decade prior to the Civil War, <i>The Heroic Slave </i>is the only fictional work by abolitionist, orator, author, and social reformer Frederick Douglass, himself a former slave.

But Were Afraid to Ask Hitchcock</h2><p>&#x2018;A modernist work of art is by definition &#x2018;incomprehensible&#x2019;; it functions as a shock, as the irruption of a trauma which undermines the complacency of our daily routine and resists being integrated. What postmodernism does, however, is the very opposite: it objects <i>par excellence</i> are products with mass appeal; the aim of the postmodernist treatment is to estrange their initial homeliness: &#x2018;you think what you see is a simple melodrama your granny would have no difficulty in following? Yet without taking into account the difference between symptom and <i>sinthom</i>/the structure of the Borromean knot/the fact that Woman is one of the Names-of-the-Father ... you&#x2019;ve totally missed the point!&#x2019; if there is an author whose name epitomises this interpretive pleasure of &#x2018;estranging&#x2019; the most banal content, it is Alfred Hitchcock (and&#x2014;useless to deny it&#x2014;this book partakes unrestrainedly in this madness).&#x2019;<br><br>Hitchcock is placed on the analyst&#x2019;s couch in this extraordinary volume of case studies, as its contributors bring to bear an unrivalled enthusiasm and theoretical sweep on the entire Hitchcock oeuvre, from <i>Rear Window</i> to <i>Psycho</i>, as an exemplar of &#x2018;postmodern&#x2019; defamiliarization. Starting from the premise that &#x2018;everything has meaning&#x2019;, the films&#x2019; ostensible narrative content and formal procedures are analysed to reveal a rich proliferation of ideological and psychical mechanisms at work. But Hitchcock is here to lure the reader into &#x2018;serious&#x2019; Marxist and Lacanian considerations on the construction of meaning.

How do potholes form and which areas have streets with the best "smoothness score"? How is mail processed? What happens when you flush the toilet? Ascher, who has a PhD in government from the London School of Economics and is now executive vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, dissects the colorful workings of all these systems and much more. <p> <i>The Works</i> contains a section on pretty much every aspect of the Big Apple's infrastructure. You'll learn the mystery of the shiny silver tanks that have become a familiar sight on New York streets. (They prevent moisture from damaging underground phone lines.) Ascher explains how the city's 23 million daily pieces of mail are processed. We also learn about the 27-mile underground pneumatic mail tube that used to carry canisters with 500 letters up to 30 miles per hour around Manhattan.

This is the story of the ape-man Tarzan, raised in the wild by the great ape Kala, and how he learns the secrets of the jungle to survive&#x2014;how to talk with the animals, swing through the trees, and fight the great predators. As Tarzan grows up, he makes many friends, including Tantor the elephant and Numa the lion. When this paradise is invaded by white men, Tarzan&#x2019;s life changes, for in this group is Jane, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Speaking directly to our childhood fantasies, this exhilarating work takes us to that faraway place in our minds where dreams prevail, and where we too can be masters of our own domain.<br><br> <b>With an Introduction by Gore Vidal</b><br><b> And an Afterword by Michael Meyer</b></p><p>First published in 1914, Edgar Rice Burroughs's romance has lost little of its force over the years--as film revivals and TV series well attest. <i>Tarzan of the Apes</i> is very much a product of its age: replete with bloodthirsty natives and a bulky, swooning American Negress, and haunted by what zoo specialists now call charismatic megafauna (great beasts snarling, roaring, and stalking, most of whom would be out of place in a real African jungle). Burroughs countervails such incorrectness, however, with some rather unattractive representations of white civilization--mutinous, murderous sailors, effete aristos, self-involved academics, and hard-hearted cowards. At Tarzan's heart rightly lies the resourceful and hunky title character, a man increasingly torn between the civil and the savage, for whom cutlery will never be less than a nightmare. <p> The passages in which the nut-brown boy teaches himself to read and write are masterly and among the book's improbable, imaginative best. How tempting it is to adopt the ten-year-old's term for letters--"little bugs"! And the older Tarzan's realization that civilized "men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle," while not exactly a new notion, is nonetheless potent. The first in Burroughs's serial is most enjoyable in its resounding oddities of word and thought, including the unforgettable "When Tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled; and smiles are the foundation of beauty."</p>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and perfect bound - a paperback.

A History from Impressionism to Today</h2><p><p>Most art historians agree that the modern art adventure first developed in the 1860s in Paris. A circle of painters, whom we now know as Impressionists, began painting pictures with rapid, loose brushwork. They turned to everyday street life for subjects, instead of overblown heroic scenes, and they escaped the power of the Salon by organizing their own independent exhibitions.</p><p>After this first assault on the artistic establishment, there was no holding back. In a constant desire to challenge, innovate, and inspire, one modernist style supplanted the next: Symbolism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada, abstract art, renewed Realism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Minimal and conceptual practice.</p><p>This indispensable overview traces the restless energy of modern art with a year-by-year succession of the groundbreaking artworks that shook standards and broke down barriers.Introductory essays outline the most significant and influential movements alongside explanatory texts for each major work and its artist.</p></p><p>Hans Werner Holzwarth is a book designer and editor specializing in contemporary art and photography.

He coined the word for it&#x2015;cybernetics. In<i> God &amp; Golem, Inc.</i>, the author concerned himself with major points in cybernetics which are relevant to religious issues.The first point he considers is that of the machine which learns. While learning is a property almost exclusively ascribed to the self-conscious living system, a computer now exists which not only can be programmed to play a game of checkers, but one which can "learn" from its past experience and improve on its own game. For a time, the machine was able to beat its inventor at checkers. "It did win," writes the author, "and it did learn to win; and the method of its learning was no different in principle from that of the human being who learns to play checkers.</p><p>A second point concerns machines which have the capacity to reproduce themselves. It is our commonly held belief that God made man in his own image. The propagation of the race may also be interpreted as a function in which one living being makes another in its own image. But the author demonstrates that man has made machines which are "very well able to make other machines in their own image," and these machine images are not merely pictorial representations but operative images. Can we then say: God is to Golem as man is to Machines? in Jewish legend, golem is an embryo Adam, shapeless and not fully created, hence a monster, an automation.The third point considered is that of the relation between man and machine. The concern here is ethical. "render unto man the things which are man's and unto the computer the things which are the computer's," warns the author. In this section of the book, Dr. Wiener considers systems involving elements of man and machine. The book is written for the intellectually alert public and does not involve any highly technical knowledge. It is based on lectures given at Yale, at the Soci�t� Philosophique de Royaumont, and elsewhere.</p></p><p>Norbert Wiener (1894&#x2013;1964) served on the faculty in the Department of Mathematics at MIT from 1919 until his death.

By the author of <i>The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino.&nbsp;</i></b><br><br> Why would the multimillionaire producer of&nbsp;<i>Cats</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Miss Saigon&nbsp;</i>take his limo from Manhattan to the struggling former steel town of Levittown, Pennsylvania, to see a high school production of&nbsp;<i>Les Mis�rables</i>?<br><br> To see the show performed by the astoundingly successful theater company at Harry S Truman High School, run by its legendary director, Lou Volpe. Broadway turns to Truman High when trying out controversial shows such as <i>Rent&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Spring</i>&nbsp;<i>Awakening&nbsp;</i>before they move on to high school theater programs across the nation. Volpe&#x2019;s students from this blue-collar town go on to become Emmy-winning producers, entertainment executives, newscasters, and community-theater founders.<br><br> Michael Sokolove, a Levittown native and former student of Volpe&#x2019;s, chronicles the drama director&#x2019;s last school years and follows a group of student actors as they work through riveting dramas both on and off the stage. This is a story of an economically depressed but proud town finding hope in a gifted teacher and the magic of theater.</p><p><b>Michael Sokolove</b> is a contributing writer for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and the author of three previous books: <i>The Ticket Out</i>, <i>Hustle</i>, and <i>Warrior Girls</i>. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland.Harry S Truman High School, set on a slight incline, is a monument to utility, neither inviting nor forbidding. Buffered on three sides by athletic fields, the school rises to just one story. Its exterior is brick&#x2014;not red brick but a dull yellowish hue, the color of putty. A framed black-and-white photograph of the nation&#x2019;s thirty-third president occupies a wall just inside the front entrance. Several big trophy cases commemorate the school&#x2019;s mostly unsuccessful athletic teams, and a big bulletin board lists the colleges that current seniors have been admitted to, along with the dollar amounts of scholarships they were awarded. <br><br>From there, the building unfolds into a grid of long hallways, lined with lockers, that come together to form lonely interior courtyards. An energetic janitorial staff buffs the floors each afternoon to a high gloss. The classroom clocks tell the right time. <br><br>Lou Volpe&#x2019;s classroom, far from the main entrance, is furnished with old couches and living room chairs, donated stuff that otherwise might have gone to Goodwill or landfills. The bookshelves, window sills, radiators and all other flat surfaces are piled high with anthologies of plays, copies of scripts, and videotapes and soundtracks of Broadway productions. Several mobiles hang from the ceiling, some low enough that a tall person has to duck around them. It is distinctly his room, even without the huge banner that says, in red block letters, LOU IS BACK. The sign appeared out of nowhere some years ago&#x2014;tacked up to the rear wall when Volpe arrived one morning&#x2014;and he knew not to ask too much about its provenance though word did eventually filter down that some students had pilfered it from a local used car lot and that &#x201c;Lou&#x201d; was apparently one of the salesmen. &#x201c;I really hope this other Lou doesn&#x2019;t miss it too much,&#x201d; Volpe says a mischievous grin when I ask him about it one day.<br><br>As we talk, he is walking a circular route around the classroom, straightening and fluffing the upholstery on the couches and chairs, a ritual he performs numerous times a day, always in a clockwise direction. It is September 2010, about week into a new school year. The final afternoon bell has just sounded and the room is beginning to fill up with students arriving to audition for the fall play. <br><br>&#x201c;Yo, Volp,&#x201d; a boy says as he walks past. &#x201c;Hey, Krause,&#x201d; he adds with a nod to Tracey Krause, a former student of Volpe&#x2019;s and now a teacher at the school and his indispensable assistant director.<br><br>Another boy breezes in and comments on Volpe&#x2019;s attire, a frequent topic of conversation, and what looks to him like peace signs on Volpe&#x2019;s belt. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;I got this belt at Woodstock. I was there, you know.&#x201d; The student laughs, knowing that Volpe would never have been anywhere near the mud and chaos of Woodstock.<br><br> Most students walk in and silently take seats. They have already endured a seven-hour school day. They plop down on the furniture and enter that resting mode of teenagers in which they are neither fully asleep nor awake but are nonetheless utterly aware. The more crowded the room gets&#x2014;meaning the more competition there will be for parts&#x2014;the quieter it becomes. <br> &nbsp;<br> The play being auditoned on this day is called <i>Good Boys and True. </i>It is a daring choice for a high school, but a typical one for Volpe&#x2014;a searingly intense drama in which a secretly recorded sex tape is discovered at a high school and a golden-boy athlete is implicated. In the play, the school&#x2019;s football captain has picked up a girl who was working at a food court in a shopping mall, and on that day, the first day he meets her, without her knowledge he films them having sex together. The tape is found in a locker and then viewed by his teammates. The boy&#x2019;s face in the tape is obscured, so his identity cannot be known for sure.<br><br> The story moves forward in a series of painful unravelings&#x2014;the school is scandalized; a family fractures; a gay relationship is revealed; a deep friendship between two boys rips apart. It is the kind of material that grips high school actors and audiences but terrifies school administrations. Volpe will be the first to put this drama on a high school stage.<br><br> Some fifty students wait in the classroom to compete for just six parts&#x2014;three female, three male. Volpe speaks for a moment before they begin. &#x201c;I hate to use the word relevant, but this play is,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It feels very <i>now. </i>Like it&#x2019;s something that could happen here, or just about anywhere.&#x201d;<br> The initial event in the play has the same effect as someone throwing a stone into a pond, he tells them. A calm is disturbed, even if it does not attract much notice at first. Ripples flow outward. It&#x2019;s one of Volpe&#x2019;s his favorite analogies. Another is the concept of doors opening&#x2014;one door opens, revealing a secret of some kind, then another and another. Once opened, the doors cannot be closed. It is how he sees theater and life, including his own.<br><br> &nbsp;He makes clear what it will take to win a role. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to need to see how far you can go. We need to see the fire. If it&#x2019;s anger, if it&#x2019;s pain, you can&#x2019;t be afraid to go to that place. I&#x2019;m not talking about shouting. I mean something you find deep inside.&#x201d; <br><br> Everyone understands. Volpe plays are full emotional commitments. And they are competitive. Nobody gets a pass into a Truman production. You can be a lead in one play and get left out of the next. It happens all the time. &#x201c;Volpe and Krause love the &#x2018;new,&#x2019;&#x201d; is how one of the girls in the room that day puts it. &#x201c;They love that new blood, that undiscovered talent, so you&#x2019;ve always got to watch your back for what&#x2019;s coming up behind you.&#x201d;<br><br> Just a week or so earlier, in New York, I had visited with Nicole Sabatini, a student of Volpe&#x2019;s in the mid-1990s. We sat in a coffee shop in the basement of 30 Rockefeller Center. A slightly built former dancer, she worked upstairs as a vice president at Bravo. &#x201c;A lot of us had an idea who Mr. Volpe was even before we got into high school,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You wanted to be part of what he created. You looked forward to it. My first year I auditioned for <i>Little Shop of Horrors </i>and didn&#x2019;t get a part, but he told me it was going to be a good three years for me, that he was impressed by me. <br><br> &#x201c;I got leads in two musicals after that. Then in my senior year, I didn&#x2019;t get a part in the drama, and then it got picked for the main stage at the national festival [the annual International Thespian Festival, a massive high school gathering each summer at the University of Nebraska]. I went to the festival as a stage manager. I had one job to do&#x2014;press &#x2018;Play&#x2019; on a cassette player to turn on some music. I&#x2019;m not gonna lie&#x2014;it hurt. But it was a big lesson for me. I had done my best at the auditions, but it wasn&#x2019;t good enough. It happens sometimes when you&#x2019;re around other people who are talented.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> The auditions are cold readings&#x2014;Volpe or his assistant, Tracy Krause, calls out page numbers and students read the lines&#x2014;but, in fact, nearly everyone has already gotten ahold of scripts and studied the story and parts. Some have read the play in their theater classes. &#x201c;That was good, very good. Thank you,&#x201d; Volpe says after a nervous tenth-grade girl finishes her reading.<br><br> The auditions move quickly, except when Volpe slows the pace with observations about the material. &#x201c;The setting here is a private school, very privileged,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted you to see how the other half lives.&#x201d; <br><br> The dialogue includes talk of colleges, elite schools where a couple of the characters have applied. One of them is Dartmouth. Confronted with it on the page, the Truman students pronounce it <i>DART-mouth</i>. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>DART-myth</i>,&#x201d; Volpe points out a couple of times, but they keep making the same mistake. Oberlin College and Vassar are equally baffling.<b> <br></b><br> Volpe and Krause select ten students for callbacks the next day. Again, Volpe appeals to them to reach for intensity. &#x201c;This is not a director&#x2019;s play. I can only stage it so much. It&#x2019;s an actor&#x2019;s play. It&#x2019;s up to you to elevate it.&#x201d;<br><br> Two boys step forward to read a scene. One is Zach Philippi, a six-foot-two, athletically built senior who has been in just one previous play. He is a baseball player, all-county, even a possible pro prospect. The other is senior Bobby Ryan, a little shorter and more slightly built, but also an athlete, a lacrosse player. He has been acting at Truman since his freshman year. Volpe gives them a scene from near the end of the play, with Philippi taking the role of the golden boy who has made the sex tape that caused the scandal. He accuses his best friend (Ryan) of informing on him to school authorities. The character played by Ryan is gay. The one played by Philippi ostensibly is not, though they have been sexually intimate. <br><br> &#x201c;If I kicked the shit out of you, would you answer me then?&#x201d; Philippi asks, as the scene builds. <br> &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; Ryan says, opening his arms wide and putting his face forward, as if he wants to be hit. &#x201c;Do it. Beat me to a pulp. Do it! I know you&#x2019;re not scared to. I know you get off on shit like that.&#x201d;<br> The scene is a denouement, ugly and raw. &#x201c;Do you know what they call you behind your back?&#x201d; Philippi shouts, and then rattles off &nbsp;a series of vulgar expressions.<br><br> The boys have moved so close to each other that their noses almost touch. It is just an audition, but riveting nonetheless. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Volpe says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good.&#x201d; There is some polite applause in the room, mostly from the girls, who will not have to compete for these two parts.<br><br> Sitting in a corner of the room by herself is Mariela Castillo. Earlier in the day, she had gotten into a screaming argument in the school corridor with her boyfriend of two years, a varsity basketball player. She has her earbud in and her knees curled up under her. Volpe considers Mariela a triple threat&#x2014;an accomplished singer, dancer and actor. &#x201c;And,&#x201d; he adds, &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t hurt that she&#x2019;s absolutely stunning-looking.&#x201d; But even though Mariela has been one of his stalwarts, she seems disengaged and in no shape to rise to the occasion and win a part. <br><br> Castillo does not volunteer to come forward&#x2014;she just sits there, radiating bad energy&#x2014;and Volpe has to finally call on her after most of the others have auditioned. He asks her to read lines from the mother of the golden boy, a difficult role for any high schooler because she will have to play the part of an adult. Castillo is wearing tight jeans and a snug-fitting T-shirt. Before she comes to the middle of the room, she pulls on a tailored blue blazer that she had set down beside her. She ties her hair back, puts on a sophisticated-looking pair of eyeglasses. She takes a breath and seems to collect herself.<br><br> &#x201c;The scene on pages twenty-nine and thirty,&#x201d; Volpe instructs. The passage comes in the play after the football coach has showed the mother the sex tape, and she confronts her son&#x2014;a person she no longer recognizes. Castillo reads the lines with a cool, simmering anger: &#x201c;I saw a boy, I saw you, lead that girl, onto what? Not even a bed, onto a mattress, on some floor . . . I saw you slap her . . . I saw you force her face onto the mattress. . . I swear, you were <i>enjoying</i> it.&#x201d;<br><br> Makeup and wardrobe would make Castillo even more convincing as a forty-five-year-old ER surgeon, which is what the mother is. But on this first reading, she calls forth distress, sadness, barely controlled rage. She seems to pull these layers from deep within, just as Volpe asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On a mid-November afternoon in 2001, a black stretch limousine set out from Manhattan, passed through the Lincoln Tunnel and headed south for fifty miles on the New Jersey Turnpike before crossing over the Delaware River and into Pennsylvania. Among its passengers&#x2014;and the person for whom the trip had been organized&#x2014;was Sir Cameron Mackintosh, the West End and Broadway producer of <i>Cats</i>, <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> and <i>Miss Saigon</i>, blockbusters that grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and afforded the producer a lavish, jet-setting lifestyle. He split his time between his apartments in London and New York, farmhouse in Provence, seaside home in Malta, and fifteen-thousand-acre estate in the Scottish Highlands. Queen Elizabeth knighted him on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1996 for &#x201c;contributions to musical theatre.&#x201d;<br><br> Cameron Mackintosh was headed to Levittown, Pennsylvania, and Truman High for a Lou Volpe production. His traveling companions&#x2014;business associates who arranged this excursion&#x2014;had fervent hopes for its success but were uneasy. It was once written of Mackintosh, &#x201c;His gut is famous.&#x201d; Meaning that he knows what he likes and what he doesn&#x2019;t and how to make that known.<br> By the measures that seem to matter most, Truman High is, at best, second-rate. Its students do not excel at standardized tests, and few of them ever go off to Ivy League colleges or other prestigious institutions, unless you put the U.S. military in that category&#x2014;the school sends plenty of its graduates straight into the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. The neighborhoods it draws from are often called blue-collar, but that is an outdated notion, one based on steady union jobs at U.S. Steel and other nearby industrial giants that are two decades gone. Parents of Truman students work at warehouses and call centers, and some supplement their incomes with shifts at fast-food restaurants. <br><br> When Truman makes news, it&#x2019;s usually for the wrong reasons, like when the class president couldn&#x2019;t give his graduation speech and an empty chair was put in his place because he was the target of a gang hit and no one wanted gunfire at commencement. In the local lexicon, Truman High, in otherwise prosperous Bucks County, is &#x201c;on the wrong side of Route 1.&#x201d;<b> </b>It was where you did not want to be and where you&#x2019;d leave if you hit the lottery. <br><br> The high school has one principal mark of distinction: Volpe&#x2019;s astoundingly successful drama program. Younger students know of him long before they reach Truman and hope to one day be in his shows. He is like the winning football coach in some down-on-its-luck Ohio or Texas town&#x2014;a beacon, a sign that grand achievement was possible, albeit unlikely. Schools with vastly greater financial resources, boasting higher-achieving students born to wealthier parents, cannot match the quality and accomplishments of Truman Drama. No high school in American can.<br><br> Volpe had joined Truman&#x2019;s faculty at age twenty-one, and the night Cameron Mackintosh was to arrive was three decades into his career. He said more than once, &#x201c;I just want to be remembered.&#x201d; He hoped that something that occurred in his classroom or at a rehearsal&#x2014;maybe something he said, an interaction between students, some spark of learning&#x2014;would be carried forward and help someone live a richer life. He hoped for his students to come to some deeper understanding of themselves, for their lives to be more fulfilling, because they had once passed his way. <br><br> And he <i>was </i>remembered. When Truman graduates stopped by the school to visit, it was always a good bet that they were were looking for Volpe.

She also was a television reading teacher, teaching children in eight cities in Ohio via a PBS program aimed at students with reading disabilities. </p> <p> After receiving her Ph.D. at The Ohio State University, Dr. McCormick joined the faculty in the College of Education at that university where she taught courses on remedial and clinical reading assessment and instruction, and on methods for instructing students with learning disabilities. She also supervised a university-based reading clinic for a number of years. </p> <p> Dr. McCormick is the author or editor of several books in addition to this one, including <i>Remedial and Clinical Reading Instruction</i> and <i>Cognitive and Social Perspectives for Literacy Research and Instruction</i> (the latter with Jerry Zutell). She publishes articles frequently in journals such as <i>Reading Research Quarterly, The Reading Teacher, Journal of Reading, Journal of Reading Behavior, Journal of Educational Research, Exceptional Children, Journal of Learning Disabilities,</i> and <i>Language Arts.</i> Dr. McCormick was coeditor of the National Reading Conference Yearbook for three years and on the editorial advisory review board for several journals. Her research interest, as might be expected, is with students having literacy problems. Though her research focus was on comprehension instruction and reading/learning disabled students for several years, currently she is investigating ways to facilitate word learning with severely delayed readers, including nonreaders. </p> <p> Dr. McCormick has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the International Reading Association, was a distinguished finalist in 1990 for the Albert J. Harris Award presented annually for significant research on reading disabilities, and has been elected to Fellow Status in the National Conference on Research in English. Dr. McCormick is a frequent presenter at national and international conferences, and she has regularly reviewed research and development proposals for the United States Department of Education. </p></p><h2>Christianity and Classical Culture: A Study of Thought and Action from Augustus to Augustine</h2><p><p><strong><em>Christianity and Classical Culture</em></strong> is considered one of the great works of scholarship published in the last century. The theme of <em>Christianity and Classical Culture</em> is the fundamental change in thought and action that occurred from the reign of Augustus to the time of Augustine. The classical world sought to practice politics and understand the world in purely rational terms, but the difficulties of this program were already evident as Christianity began developing a completely new understanding of the human world. It is from this revolution in ideas that our modern world was forged.</p> <p>W. H. Auden wrote of an earlier edition in <em>The New Republic</em>: &#x201c;Since the appearance of the first edition in 1940, I have read this book many times, and my conviction of its importance to the understanding not only of the epoch with which it is concerned, but also of our own, has increased with each rereading.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Charles Norris Cochrane</strong> (1889&#x2013;1945) was educated at the University of Toronto and Oxford (Corpus Christi College) and taught at the University of Toronto.</p></p><p>Charles Norris Cochrane (1889-1945) was educated at the University of Toronto and Oxford (Corpus Christi College). He taught at the University of Toronto, then served overseas for Canada in World War I before going back to Oxford for his MA in 1919. Returning to Toronto, he became Assistant Professor of Greek and Roman History, then Dean of Residence, and finally full professor and the head of the department of Greek and Roman History.Originally published in 1940, <b><i>Christianity and Classical Culture: A Study of Thought and Action from Augustus to Augustine</i></b> by Charles Norris Cochrane (1889-1945) is a thoughtful, insightful, informative examination of the contrast and sometimes clash between the classical era's culture and struggle to understand the world in purely rational terms, and the completely new understanding of the world developed and spread by Christianity. From divisions of church and state; to the impact that Constantine and the spread of Christianity had; to a technical dissection of propositions concerning sometimes starkly different worldviews, <i><b>Christianity and Classical Culture</b></i> has survived the test of time to remain a pillar of philosophical, religious, and cultural analysis. <p></p><b>John Taylor<br><i>The Midwest Book Review</i><br> February 2004</b> <p></p><br> The reissue of the classic work published in 1940 by Oxford University Press, this volume describes the revolution in thought and action that came about through the impact of Christianity upon the Greco-Roman world in the period from Augustus and Virgil to Theodosius and Augustine. Under the heading "reconstruction' it first considers the following topics: <i>pax Augusta</i>--the restored republic;<i> Romanitas</i>--empire and commonwealth; <i>Roma aeterna</i>--the apotheosis of power; and <i>regnum Caesaris regnum diaboli</i>. Then under "renovation" it discusses these topics: the new republic--Constantine and the triumph of the cross; <i>Quid Athenae Hierosolymis?</i>--the impasse of Constantinianism; apostasy and reaction; state and church in the new republic; and Theodosius and the religion of state. Finally under "regeneration" it deals with these matters: the church and the kingdom of God; <i>nostra philosophia</i>--the discovery of personality; and divine necessity and human history. An appendix (pp. 573-609) included in this edition provides English translations (by K. Alvis and J. Alvis) of the Latin and Greek words and phrases that appear in the main text. Cochrane (1889-1945) was professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Toronto. <p></p><i><b>New Testament Abstracts</b></i><br><b>January 2005</b> <p></p><br> For 64 years <i><b>Christianity and Classical Culture</b></i> has stood as a definitive study of this practice of politics and the understanding of the world in rational terms during classical times, and the revolution in this thinking with the advent of Christianity. With fresh translations of the Latin and Greek, Liberty Fund arranged for this edition with the original publisher, Oxford University Press, as part of the its encouragement of study of the ideal of a society of free and responsible individuals. As the title suggests, this is not a casual read, but a scholarly text. The theme is explored in three parts: <br>- Reconstruction of the Roman Empire, including the influence of Hellenization and the rise of Christianity; <br> - Reconstruction, with Constantine's creation of the Holy Roman Empire and the development of government services, and Theodosius' transformation of it into an Orthodox Empire; and <br> - Regeneration, with the acceptance of the Nicene Creed, development of theologico-ehical values, and the continuing influence of Roman ideas of justice and power.<br> It is interesting to read this book in the post-Sept. 11, 2001, world, where many of the actions and ideas of classical Roman times are seemingly being repeated in a modern context, by leaders in the United States, Europe and the Middle East alike. <p></p><i><b>Carroll County News Weekend Edition</b></i><br><b>April 2004</b> <p></p><br>Click here for a pdf of a brochure featuring <i>Christianity and Classical Culture</i><p></p> <p></p><br></p><h2>The Golden Age of Dutch Art: Painting, Sculpture, Decorative Art</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated survey of seventeenth-century Dutch art focuses on the country&#39;s &#34;Golden Age,&#34; which was dominated by the likes of Hals, Rembrandt, Ruisdael, Steen, and Vermeer.</p><p>On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, an exhibition gathering many of the finest existing examples of Dutch 17th-century art has been staged, mixing works owned by the museum and others on loan from many institutions around the world. Researchers at the Rijksmuseum provide descriptive entries for each of more than 200 objects, including some interpretation of meaning, history of the object since creation, and biography of the artist. The reproductions, in color for all the main pieces, tend to be a little dark, however, so that some of the details mentioned are difficult to see. Still, because the information presented is fairly basic and all major artists of this seminal period are included, this catalog serves well as an overview of the Golden Age in Dutch art.

Its brilliant anatomization of the snobbery and hypocrisy of the wealthy elite of New York society in the 1870s made it an instant classic, and it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. Newland Archer, Wharton's protagonist, charming, tactful, enlightened, is a thorough product of this society; he accepts its standards and abides by its rules but he also recognizes its limitations. His engagement to the impeccable May Welland assures him of a safe and conventional future, until the arrival of May's cousin Ellen Olenska. Independent, free-thinking, scandalously separated from her husband, Ellen forces Archer to question the values and assumptions of his narrow world. As their love for each other grows, Archer has to decide where his ultimate loyalty lies.<br>Stephen Orgel's introduction and notes set the novel in the context of the period and discusses Wharton's skilfull weaving of characters and plot, her anthropological exactitude, and the novel's autobiographical overtones. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Somewhere in this book, Wharton observes that clever liars always come up with good stories to back up their fabrications, but that really clever liars don't bother to explain anything at all. This is the kind of insight that makes <i>The Age of Innocence </i> so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had rules as rigid as any in history.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

To the right, Hughes fires broadsides at the populist demagogy of Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, Jesse Helms and especially Ronald Reagan ("with somnambulistic efficiency, Reagan educated America down to his level. He left his country a little stupider in 1988 than it had been in 1980, and a lot more tolerant of lies"). To the left, he skewers political correctness ("political etiquette, not politics itself"), Afrocentrism, and academic obsessions with theory ("The world changes more deeply, widely, thrillingly than at any moment since 1917, perhaps since 1848, and the American academic left keeps fretting about how phallocentricity is inscribed in Dickens' portrayal of Little Nell"). PC censoriousness and "family-values" rhetoric, he argues, are only two sides of the same character, extrusions of America's puritan heritage into the present--and, at root, signs of America's difficulty in seeing past the end of the Us-versus-Them mentality implanted by four decades of the Cold War.<br> In the long retreat from public responsibility beaten by America in the 80s, Hughes sees "a hollowness at the cultural core"--a nation "obsessed with therapies and filled with distrust of formal politics; skeptical of authority and prey to superstition; its language corroded by fake pity and euphemism." It resembles "late Rome...in the corruption and verbosity of its senators, in its reliance on sacred geese (those feathered ancestors of our own pollsters and spin-doctors) and in its submission to senile, deified emperors controlled by astrologers and extravagant wives."<br> <em>Culture of Complaint</em> is fired by a deep concern for the way Hughes sees his adopted country heading. But it is not a relentless diatribe. If Hughes lambastes some aspects of American politics, he applauds Vaclav Havel's vision of politics "not as the art of the useful, but politics as practical morality, as service to the truth." And if he denounces PC, he offers a brilliant and heartfelt defence of non-ideological multiculturalism as an antidote to Americans' difficulty in imagining the rest of the world--and other Americans.<br> Here, then, is an extraordinary <em>cri de coeur</em>, an outspoken call for the reconstruction of America's ideas about its recent self. It is a book that everyone interested in American culture will want to read.<br></p><p><br>Born in Sydney, Australia, in 1938, <strong>Robert Hughes</strong> has been the art critic of <em>Time</em> since he moved from Europe to the United States in 1970. His books--<em>The Shock of the New</em>, <em>The Fatal Shore</em>, <em>Nothing if Not Critical</em>, <em>Barcelona</em>--have won many awards in Australia, America, and Europe, most recently (1992) the international <em>El Brusi</em> prize for literature and communications given by the Olimpiada Cultural in Barcelona.<br>"Perhaps the most sensible book that has been written on the vexed subjects of multiculturalism and 'political correctness.'....Culture of Complaint is a wonderful handheld-camera tour of the Dumb Zones of American life, and as such provides more than enough intelligent<br>pleasure."--Artforum<br><br>"Focusing on the contemporary art world, university censorship controversies, the politics of grants, pop culture, and the mostly contrived and contradictory uproar about the Western canon, Hughes--in language free of theory and academic duckspeak--not only criticises and condemns, but offers<br>solutions as well....In his independence of mind he reminds one of other writers such as Barbara Ehrenreich, Stanley Crouch, Christopher Lasch and Henry Louis Gates, Jr."--The Portland Alliance<br><br>"Hughes has the ability to antagonize everyone while bringing fresh angles of vision to the discussion."--Christian Century<br><br>"Hughes has proven himself a remarkably thorough historian and cosmopolitan social analyst....Hughes here offers a prickly, sarcastic precis of the country where he's happily resided for the last 22 years."--The Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br>"Hughes brings to the currently white-hot topic of U.S. cultural values an outsider's appprehension of what is distinctly American and a domestic reporter's knowledge of U.S. cultural particulars....Never deserted by his rapier wit, Hughes delivers the most enjoyable, most sensible<br>contribution to date of the American cultural debate."--Booklist<br><br>"It's hard not to be stirred up and entertained by the three jeremiad-essays Hughs offers here."--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Thoughtful, passionate, witty, closely argued attack on American extremism and its consequences....A provocative and compelling piece of social commentary."--Newport News Daily Press<br><br>"An inescapably quotable bible of intellectual common sense."--David Denby in The New Republic<br><br>"Robert Hughes is mad as hell. And as anyone remotely familiar with his art reviews in Time magazine knows, when Hughes gets angry he is at his best....He is characteristically eloquent in Culture of Complaint."--The San Diego Union<br><br>"Hughes deftly illustrates the inadequacy of our current responses to perceived social and political problems."--The Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>Promethean Fire: Reflections on the Origin of the Mind</h2><p>Argues that a mutual change in genetics and culture brought about the development of human mental capacity</p><p><b>Edward O.

"Pride and Prejudice seems as vital today as ever, " writes Anna Quindlen in her introduction to this Modern Library edition. "It is a pure joy to read." Eudora Welty agrees: "The gaiety is unextinguished, the irony has kept its bite, the reasoning is still sweet, the sparkle undiminished. [It is] irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be." <br>This volume is the companion to the BBC television series, a lavish production aired on the Arts and Entertainment Network.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The ModernLibrary continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p>This is the first of the novels published in &#39;The Oxford Illustrated Jane Austen&#39; series, illustrated with early nineteenth-century plates. From its famous opening sentence, the story of the Bennet family and of the novel&#39;s two protagonists, Elizabeth and Darcy, told with a wit that its author feared might prove &#39;rather too light and bright, and sparkling, &#39; delights its most familiar readers as thoroughly as it does those who encounter it for the first time. And while she entertains us, Jane Austen teaches us the wisdom of balance, the folly of &#39;pride&#39; and &#39;prejudice.&#39;Jane Austen (1775-1817), one of Britain&#39;s best-loved authors, led an uneventful life. Her novels deal with the relationships and manners of the English middle-class, and she wrote with a wit and sharpness of observation that have made her famous to this day.</p><h2>Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets</h2><p>``Solution Selling is the most comprehensive sales and sales management process available today.

With this new translation, Mauss&#x2019; classic essay is returned to its original context, published alongside the works that framed its first publication in the 1923&#x2013;24 issue of <i>L&#x2019;Ann�e Sociologique</i>. With a critical foreword by Bill Maurer and a new introduction by translator Jane Guyer, this expanded edition is certain to become the standard English version of the essay&#x2014;a gift that keeps on giving.<br> <br> Included alongside the &#x201c;Essay on the Gift&#x201d; are Mauss&#x2019; memorial accounts of the work of �mile Durkheim and his colleagues who were lost during World War I, as well as his scholarly reviews of influential contemporaries such as Franz Boas, J. G. Frazer, Bronislaw Malinowski, and others. Read in the context of these additional pieces, the &#x201c;Essay on the Gift&#x201d; is revealed as a complementary whole, a gesture of both personal and political generosity: Mauss&#x2019; honor for his fallen colleagues; his aspiration for modern society&#x2019;s recuperation of the gift as a mode of repair; and his own careful, yet critical, reading of his intellectual milieu. The result sets the scene for a whole new generation of readers to study this essay alongside pieces that exhibit the erudition, political commitment, and generous collegial exchange that first nourished the essay into life.</p></p><p><b>Marcel Mauss </b>(1870&#x2013;1950) was a French sociologist and founding figure of twentieth-century anthropology. <b>Jane I. Guyer </b>is the George Armstrong Kelly Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Johns Hopkins University."<i>The Gift</i> is surely the most misunderstood work in the history of anthropology. Marcel Mauss is not entirely without blame for this. It is a work of notoriously scattershot brilliance; but, as a result, the essay has become a kind of screen for the projection of every sort of fantasy. Guyer&#x2019;s excellent new edition will go a long way towards finally straightening matters out. There are endless riches here. But finally they are also in a form where we can see exactly what we&#x2019;re being given." (David Graeber, author of&nbsp;Debt: The First 5,000 Years)<br><br>"<i>The Gift</i> is like a river that carries an immense mass of facts set in motion by Mauss&#x2019; vision. Guyer proves to be a skilled guide in navigating its perilous currents by giving us a nuanced translation that explores the text&#x2019;s most secluded coves." (Maurice Godelier, author of&nbsp;The Enigma of the Gift)<br><br>"Marcel Mauss wrote <i>The Gift</i> to refute the contrast between free gifts and self-interested markets. Yet, the opposition that he attacked&#x2014;gift economy versus market economy&#x2014;is often attributed to Mauss himself. Previous English translations were taken out of their historical context. Guyer has restored that context and has made the sociological argument more explicit. This long overdue publication will transform the essay&#x2019;s reception, and stands to correct a text whose fame far surpasses most readers&#x2019; grasp of its meaning." (Keith Hart, author of&nbsp;The Memory Bank: Money in an Unequal World)<br><br>"Not only is Guyer extremely attentive to the wealth of connotations stirred by every word, in every language; she is also attuned to understanding Mauss&#x2019; essay in the context in which it was written. This gives the reader the sense that Mauss is finally grasped fully&#x2014;as an inexhaustible source of inspiration." (Alain Caill�, author of&nbsp;The World of the Gift&nbsp;(with J. Godbout) and editor of&nbsp;Revue du MAUSS)</p><h2>Modern Systems Analysis and Design</h2><p><p> <i>For Structured Systems Analysis and Design courses.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Help Readers Become Effective Systems Analysts </b> </p> <p>Using a professionally-oriented approach, <b> <i>Modern Systems Analysis and Design</i> </b> covers the concepts, skills, and techniques essential for systems analysts to successfully develop information systems. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The <b>Eighth Edition</b> examines the role, responsibilities, and mindset of systems analysts and project managers.

This book explores the subject in full, with a complete illustrated account of labyrinths and mazes of all kinds, from earliest times to the present.<br>There are labyrinths that consist entirely of rooms and columns, like the Egyptian Labyrinth itself. There are the labyrinths of ancient history and of myth, such as the celebrated Cretan maze in which Theseus slew the Minotaur. There are labyrinths constructed of caverns, those built to protect tombs, and those designed to guard treasures. Labyrinthine patterns have been used in gardens (such as the famous Hampton Court maze), embossed on coins, employed as emblems of royalty, made to represent allegories, built of stones, embedded into the pavements of early churches, and made into toys. We learn about all of them &#x2014; all that is known, for mystery seems an inescapable part of the story of the labyrinth.<br>With devoted scholarship and a nice appreciation for what he terms &#x201c;the lure of the labyrinth,&#x201d; the author takes us through accounts of the ancient mazes, the &#x201c;meanders&#x201d; of Greek and Roman times, theories on the meaning of church labyrinths, the &#x201c;mizmaze,&#x201d; turf mazes and their origins, the floral labyrinth, the hedge maze, examples in stones and carved on rocks, links between labyrinths and magic, maze etymology, hints on maze design and principles of solution, the labyrinth in literature, the labyrinth in strange places, mirror mazes, and even a verbal labyrinth. All important or exceptional examples are illustrated.<br>This is a book for anyone who is intrigued by puzzles or beguiled by mysteries, a book for the historian, the mathematician, the student, the lover of the classic, and all those who enjoy reading the product of a cultivated mind dwelling on a subject that touches much of our cultural and artistic heritage.</p><p></p><h2>Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume 2: Since 1863</h2><p>Understanding the past helps us navigate the present and future. This book teaches readers about American history and exposes them to movies and other forms of popular culture that tell the stories of the nation&#39;s past. A highly respected and thoroughly modern approach to U.S. history, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, POWER, Seventh Edition, shows how the United States was transformed, in a relatively short time, from a land inhabited by hunter-gatherer and agricultural Native American societies into the most powerful industrial nation on Earth. This approach helps readers understand the impact of the notions of liberty and equality, which are often associated with the American story, and recognize how dominant and subordinate groups have affected and been affected by the ever-shifting balance of power.</p><p>John M.

In this concise book, scholar and master-teacher Wright focuses on the key concepts and works presented within a typical Music Appreciation course, avoids lengthy discussions on side topics, and includes a set of integrated digital resources that make it easy--and fun--for you to master the material. THE ESSENTIAL LISTENING TO MUSIC is approximately 60 percent shorter than the large volume and is priced much lower than our larger texts. This chronological text discusses musical examples from each historical period, each discussed within its social context. This provides you with a sense of a piece&#39;s construction, as well as its historical and cultural meaning. THE ESSENTIAL LISTENING TO MUSIC includes a wide range of resources designed to develop listening skills and challenge you: a free &#34;Introduction to Listening&#34; CD, packaged with each copy of the text; Listening Exercises built into the book and online (unique to Wright&#39;s text); ; streaming music and downloads; computer-enhanced Active Listening Guides; and listening quizzes for all of the music in the text. All of these are included within CourseMate, a comprehensive online learning environment. You can download all of the music that is covered in the text -- directly to a music library --using the Sony Music Download Card that is bound into the book. An optional two-CD set is also available.</p><p>Craig M. Wright received his Bachelor of Music degree at the Eastman School of Music in 1966 and his Ph.D. in musicology from Harvard University in 1972. He began his teaching career at the University of Kentucky and for the past forty years has been teaching at Yale University, where he is currently the Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Music. At Yale, Wright&#39;s courses include his perennially popular introductory course, Listening to Music (also part of the offerings of Open Yale Courses); his large lecture course Exploring the Nature of Genius; and most recently his Coursera course Introduction to Classical Music. He is the author of numerous scholarly books and articles on composers ranging from Leoninus to Bach. Wright has also been the recipient of many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Einstein and Kinkeldey Awards of the American Musicological Society, and the Dent Medal of the International Musicological Society. In 2004, he was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago. And in 2010 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, joining fellow inductee, banjo player Steve Martin. In addition to LISTENING TO MUSIC and LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC, EIGHTH EDITION, Wright has also published THE ESSENTIAL LISTENING TO MUSIC, SECOND EDITION; LISTENING TO MUSIC, CHINESE EDITION (Schirmer Cengage Learning/Three Union Press, 2012), translated and simplified by Profs. Li Xiujung (China Conservatory, Beijing) and Yu Zhigang (Central Conservatory, Beijing), both of whom worked with Wright at Yale; and MUSIC IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION, MEDIA UPDATE (Schirmer Cengage Learning, 2010), with coauthor Bryan Simms. He is currently at work on a volume titled MOZART&#39;S BRAIN: EXPLORING THE NATURE OF GENIUS."I really enjoyed the fresh approach.

The overall tone of the writing is right on the money, and perfect for today's students."<br><br>"Yes, the writing is extremely clear and it is at the appropriate level. I found myself reading all of the text (even when I only expected to skim some passages). The material is presented in an interesting and up-to-date manner, especially, with references to modern pop composers.... I particularly liked the biographical materials on the composers. The information reflects current scholarship and it is accurate. I also liked the material on . . . society, which shed light on the period and helps students understand the social and cultural issues surrounding the composer and his works."<br><br>"I am very fond of the musical examples and the references to YouTube. This is an increasingly important tool for teaching if used well, and I think the incorporation here is well done. I am considering online instruction for this course, and I think this material is well suited to spark discussion and interest. . . . The brevity, with good musical examples, looks like it would fit well into a semester's coverage."<br><br>"This text is a chronological journey through music history that is significantly shorter in length than most, hence the title, focusing on the most important composers and genres from each era without an overload of unnecessary terms or concepts. Therefore, it is a better fit for non-majors taking their first music course, as it introduces musical terms and guidelines of how to listen to Classical music."</p><h2>Unchopping a Tree</h2><p>There&#x2019;s no mystery to chopping down a tree. But how do you put back together a tree that&#x2019;s been felled? Mystical instructions are required, and that&#x2019;s what W. S. Merwin provides in his prose piece Unchopping a Tree,&#x201d; appearing for the first time in a self-contained volume. Written with a poet&#x2019;s grace, an ecologist&#x2019;s insights, and a Buddhist&#x2019;s reverence for life, this elegant work describes the difficult, sacred job of reconstructing a tree. Step by step, page by page, with Merwin&#x2019;s humble authority, secrets are revealed, and the destroyed tree rises from the forest floor. <i>Unchopping a Tree</i> opens with simplicity and grace: Start with the leaves, the small twigs, and the nest that have been shaken, ripped, or broken off by the fall; these must be gathered and attached once again to their respective places.&#x201d; W. S. Merwin, like many conservationists, is quick to say: When we destroy the so-called natural world around us we&#x2019;re simply destroying ourselves. And I think it&#x2019;s irreversible.&#x201d; Thus the tree takes on a scale that begs the reader&#x2019;s compassion, and one tree is a parable for the restoration of all nature.</p><p><b>W. S. Merwin</b>, poet, translator, and environmental activist, is one of the most widely read--and imitated--poets in America. The son of a Presbyterian minister, whom he began writing hymns for at the age of five, Merwin went to Europe as a young man and developed a love of languages that led to work as a literary translator. Over the years his poetic voice has moved from the more formal and medieval--influenced somewhat by Robert Graves and the medieval<br>poetry he was then translating--to a more distinctly American voice, following his two years in Boston where he got to know Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Adrienne Rich, and Donald Hall, all of whom were breaking out of the rhetoric of the 1950s. Merwin&#x2019;s recent poetry is perhaps his most personal, arising from his deeply held beliefs. He is not only profoundly anti-imperialist, pacifist, and environmentalist but also possessed by an intimate feeling for landscape and language and the ways land and language interflow. His latest poems are densely imagistic and full of an intimate awareness of the natural world.<br><br>His first book, <i>A Mask for Janus</i>, was chosen by W. H. Auden in 1952 for the Yale Younger Poets Prize. <i>The Carrier of Ladders</i> received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize. Among his other books of poems are <i>The Drunk in the Furnace, The Moving Target, The Lice, Flower &amp; Hand, The Compass Flower, Feathers from the Hill, Opening the Hand, The Rain in the Trees, Travels, The Vixen, The Lost Upland, Unframed Originals, The Folding Cliffs, The River Sound, The Pupil</i>, a translation of Dante&#x2019;s <i>Purgatorio</i> the critically lauded translation of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, as well as <i>Present Company</i>, which won the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry, <i>Migration: Selected Poems 1951-2001</i>, which won the National Book Award, and <i>The Shadow of Sirius</i>, which received the Pulitzer Prize (Merwin's second). A two-volume set, <i>The Collected Poems of W. S. Merwin</i>, was published in May 2013. Merwin's prose includes <i>The Mays of Ventadorn</i>, part of the National Geographic Directions series, <i>The Ends of the Earth</i> (essays), and the memoir <i>Summer Doorways</i>. Recent reissues of his books are <i>The First Four Books of Poems</i>, <i>Spanish Ballads</i>, translations of Jean Follain&#x2019;s poetry collection <i>Transparence of the World</i> and Antonio Porchia&#x2019;s <i>Voices</i>, and <i>The Book of Fables</i>, a reissue of (<i>The Miner&#x2019;s Pale Children</i> and <i>Houses and Travelers</i>). Forthcoming are the poetry collection <i>Before Morning</i> (Copper Canyon, April 2014) and a booklength essay, <i>Unchopping a Tree</i> (Trinity University Press, March 2014).<br><br>Merwin was named poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1999, along with poets Rita Dove and Louise Gl�ck. He has been honored as laureate of the Struga Poetry Evenings Festival in Macedonia and as recipient of the international Golden Wreath Award, the 2004 Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Pulitzer Prize (twice), the National Book Award, the Tanning Prize, the Bollingen Prize, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, and the first Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award, in 2013. He was appointed U.S. poet laureate in 2010.<br><br>Merwin has spent the last thirty years planting nineteen acres with over 800 species of palm, creating a sustainable forest; the property recently became the Merwin Conservancy (http://www.merwinconservancy.org).

It is not arduous work, unless major limbs have been smashed or mutilated.<br><br>If the fall was carefully and correctly planned, the chances of anything of the kind happening will have been reduced.

In such a scenario, it makes sense to focus on the most identifiable and urgent problems, right? Actually, it doesn't. In his classic essay "The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge," Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the man who helped bring Albert Einstein to the United States, describes a great paradox of scientific research. The search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications, often leads not only to the greatest scientific discoveries but also to the most revolutionary technological breakthroughs. In short, no quantum mechanics, no computer chips.</p><p>This brief book includes Flexner's timeless 1939 essay alongside a new companion essay by Robbert Dijkgraaf, the Institute's current director, in which he shows that Flexner's defense of the value of "the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge" may be even more relevant today than it was in the early twentieth century. Dijkgraaf describes how basic research has led to major transformations in the past century and explains why it is an essential precondition of innovation and the first step in social and cultural change. He makes the case that society can achieve deeper understanding and practical progress today and tomorrow only by truly valuing and substantially funding the curiosity-driven "pursuit of useless knowledge" in both the sciences and the humanities.</p></p><p><p>"Flexner and Dijkgraaf argue that basic research--driven by curiosity, freedom, and imagination--is a proven and essential seed for the revolutionary technologies that fuel the economy, transform society, and provide solutions for the world's problems. A thoughtful appeal for long-term thinking in a time full of short-term distractions."<b>--Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet Inc.</b></p><p>"These two eloquent essays are timely and timeless treasures that remind us why and how the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake has transformed humanity and human affairs. <i>The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge</i> is a gift to all those concerned with the world of tomorrow."<b>--Sean B. Carroll, author of <i>The Serengeti Rules</i> and <i>Brave Genius</i></b></p><p>"In essays written more than seventy years apart, the founding and current directors of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study demonstrate how human progress has depended--quite unexpectedly--on unfettered scholarship carried out by talented, obsessively curious individuals. The time lag from their discoveries to practical benefit will be long and the path unpredictable. But here is the bottom line: as strange as it seems, humanity&#x2019;s future is likely to depend on society&#x2019;s greatly increased support for fundamental, seemingly &#x2018;impractical&#x2019; research."<b>--Bruce Alberts, University of California, San Francisco, and former editor-in-chief of <i>Science</i> magazine</b></p><p>"<i>The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge</i> is excellent. Dijkgraaf's essay is a remarkable piece of writing that eloquently puts Flexner's essay in historical context, revealing the influence of his vision on the twentieth century and reevaluating it in the light of the twenty-first."<b>--Carlo Rovelli, author of <i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i></b></p><p>"Flexner's brilliant essay is as valuable today as when it was first published. And Dijkgraaf's eloquent companion essay, which admirably connects the situation facing past and present advocates of basic scientific research, is a pleasure to read. <i>The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge</i> will be very useful in the intense global debate over this vital topic."<b>--Neil Turok, Director and Niels Bohr Chair, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</b></p><b>Abraham Flexner</b> (1866&#x2013;1959) was the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the world's leading institutions for basic research in the sciences and humanities. <b>Robbert Dijkgraaf, </b>a mathematical physicist who specializes in string theory, is director and Leon Levy Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study.

Through personal narratives and qualitative empirical studies, more than 40 authors expose the daunting challenges faced by academic women of color as they navigate the often hostile terrain of higher education, including hiring, promotion, tenure, and relations with students, colleagues, and administrators. The narratives are filled with wit, wisdom, and concrete recommendations, and provide a window into the struggles of professional women in a racially stratified but increasingly multicultural America.</p><p>"This book felt so painfully familiar I almost could not read it. Those of us who started our careers as firsts and onlys have had to forget much about the cruelty hidden in academic enclaves.

Today everything from a fetishist's dream appears on the fashion runways. Although some people regard fetish fashion as exploitative and misogynistic, others interpret it as a positive Amazonian statement--couture Catwoman. But the connection between fashion and fetishism goes far beyond a few couture collections. For the past thirty years, the iconography of sexual fetishism has been increasingly assimilated into popular culture. Before Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, there was Mrs. Peel, heroine of the 1960s television show "The Avengers," who wore a black leather catsuit modeled on a real fetish costume. Street styles like punk and the gay "leatherman" look also testify to the influence of fetishism.<br> The concept of fetishism has recently assumed a growing importance in critical thinking about the cultural construction of sexuality. Yet until now no scholar with an in-depth knowledge of fashion history has studied the actual clothing fetishes themselves. Nor has there been a serious exploration of the historical relationship between fashion and fetishism, although erotic styles have changed significantly and "sexual chic" has become increasingly conspicuous.<br> Cultural historian Valerie Steele has devoted much of her career to the study of the relationship between clothing and sexuality, and is uniquely qualified to write this book. Marshalling a dazzling array of evidence from pornography, psychology, and history, as well as interviews with individuals involved in sexual fetishism, sadomasochism, and cross-dressing, Steele illuminates the complex relationship between appearance and identity. Based on years of research, her book <em>Fetish: Fashion, Sex &amp; Power</em> explains how a paradigm shift in attitudes toward sex and gender has given rise to the phenomenon of fetish fashion.<br> "Steele is to fetish dressing what Anne Rice is to vampires," writes Christa Worthington of <em>Elle</em> magazine, "the intellectual interpreter of...wishes beyond our ken." According to Steele, fetishism shows how human sexuality is never just a matter of doing what comes naturally; fantasy always plays an important role. Steele provides provocative answers to such questions as: Why is black regarded as the sexiest color? Is fetishizing the norm for males? Does fetish fashion reflect a fear of AIDS? And why do so many people love shoes?<br></p><p>Because this is Valerie Steele&#39;s second book on the topic of fetishistic clothing, her opening statements that she is an outsider to the paraphilias and perversions that she discusses seems a bit hollow. When she says that she is only &#34;a cultural historian specializing in fashion&#34; there&#39;s no need to fear: while the book is rigorously researched and loaded with valuable bibliographic references to previous researchers in the area, it&#39;s apparent that underneath her cool prose Steele really gets a kick out of her subject, if only on an intellectual level. Dividing her book into sections based on the various fetishes (corsets, shoes, second-skin fabrics, underwear), Steele shows a remarkable facility with the history and trivia of each item of clothing. This produces some amusing juxtapositions, such as when she reveals little-known information about the Chinese practice of footbinding, and a page later presents a Tom of Finland picture of a nude man surrounded by motorcycle-booted feet. There are plenty of drawings and photographs here, ostensibly to supplement the reading. Photos range from 19th-century Viennese ultra-high-heeled shoes to contemporary neo- gothic hipster chicks in corsets and leather. This is obviously not a book for children, but it&#39;s also far more than a collection of erotica in that it presents an informative and well-researched history of fetishism and the theories that have been put forward to explain it.<br><strong>Valerie Steele</strong> is a cultural historian specializing in the history of fashion. She received her Ph.D. from Yale University and teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Dr. Steele has appeared frequently on television and radio. Her other books include <em>Fashion and Eroticism</em>, <em>Paris Fashion</em>, <em>Men</em> <em>and Women: Dressing the Part</em>, and <em>Women of Fashion</em>.<br></p><h2>Dona Perfecta</h2><p>Some annotations on about 10 pages.

Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor-the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. <br>Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in "The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in "The Return of the King.<br>In the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins (hero of The Hobbit) passed along his magical ring to his orphaned nephew, Frodo--unwittingly setting its original owner, the horrible Gollum, on his trail. Lest the ring fall into evil hands, Frodo sought to destroy it at the Mountain of Fire in the enemy land of Mordor. He convened the Companions of the Ring to carry out this perilous mission, but his brave band has been scattered, beset by orc-soldiers, and in the Second Part, as &#39;the great Darkness&#39; descends, Frodo himself has mysteriously disappeared.</p><h2>Menschen.

Born the seventh child of the rector of Steventon, Hampshire, on December 16, 1775, she was educated mainly at home. At an early age she began writing sketches and satires of popular novels for her family&#x2019;s entertainment. As a clergyman&#x2019;s daughter from a well-connected family, she had ample opportunity to study the habits of the middle class, the gentry, and the aristocracy. At 21, she began a novel called &#x201c;The First Impressions,&#x201d; an early version of&nbsp;<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. In 1801, on her father&#x2019;s retirement, the family moved to the fashionable resort of Bath. Two years later she sold the first version of&nbsp;<i>Northanger Abby</i>&nbsp;to a London publisher, but the first of her novels to appear in print was&nbsp;<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, published at her own expense in 1811. It was followed by&nbsp;<i>Pride and Prejudice</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1813),&nbsp;<i>Mansfield Park</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1814), and&nbsp;<i>Emma</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1815).After her father died in 1805, the family first moved to Southampton then to Chawton Cottage in Hampshire. Despite this relative retirement, Jane Austen was still in touch with a wider world, mainly through her brothers; one had become a very rich country gentleman, another a London banker, and two were naval officers. Though her many novels were published anonymously, she had many early and devoted readers, among them the Prince Regent and Sir Walter Scott. In 1816, in declining health, Austen wrote&nbsp;<i>Persuasion</i><b>&nbsp;</b>and revised&nbsp;<i>Northanger Abby</i><b>.</b>&nbsp;Her last work,&nbsp;<i>Sandition</i>, was left unfinished at her death on July 18, 1817. She was buried in Winchester Cathedral. Austen&#x2019;s identity as an author was announced to the world posthumously by her brother Henry, who supervised the publication of&nbsp;<i>Northanger Abby</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Persuasion</i>&nbsp;in 1818.<br><br><b>Chellie Carroll</b>&nbsp;studied applied arts at the University&nbsp;of Derby, and had a brief stint as a designer in retail.&nbsp;She is an artist based out of the UK, where she enjoys living in the beautiful and historic Peak District.

Kabbalah, according to its increasingly large group of practitioners, is the path from that fleeting feeling of pleasure that most people settle for to the lasting fulfillment that is their birthright as human beings. In <i>El poder de la Cabal,</i> renowned teacher Yehuda Berg shows how to view and navigate through life by tapping Kabbalistic truths. He explains the key process of transforming from a reactive to a proactive being that will in turn trigger increased creative energy, greater personal power, and a stronger and more satisfying sense of life. These teachings include embracing rather than avoiding problems and obstacles as true opportunities for spiritual development; making miracles through positive thinking; and accepting responsibility for what happens in one's life.<br></p><p>The codirector of Kabbalah Centre International Inc., Yehuda Berg is a prominent authority on Kabbalah.

Unified by the recurring presence of young George Willard, and played out against the backdrop of Winesburg, Anderson&#x2019;s loosely connected chapters, or stories, coalesce into a powerful novel.<br><br>In such tales as &#x201c;Hands,&#x201d; the portrayal of a rural berry picker still haunted by the accusations of homosexuality that ended his teaching career, Anderson&#x2019;s vision is as acute today as it was over eighty-five years ago. His intuitive ability to home in on examples of timeless, human conflicts&#x2014;a workingman deciding if he should marry the woman who is to bear his child, an unhappy housewife who seeks love from the town&#x2019;s doctor, an unmarried high school teacher sexually attracted to a pupil&#x2014;makes this book not only immensely readable but also deeply meaningful. An important influence on Faulkner, Hemingway, and others who were drawn to Anderson&#x2019;s innovative format and psychological insights, <b>Winesburg, Ohio</b> deserves a place among the front ranks of our nation&#x2019;s finest literary achievements.</p><p><i>Library Journal</i> praised this edition of Sherwood Anderson's famed short stories as "the finest edition of this seminal work available." Reconstructed to be as close to the original text as possible, <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> depicts the strange, secret lives of the inhabitants of a small town. In "Hands," Wing Biddlebaum tries to hide the tale of his banishment from a Pennsylvania town, a tale represented by his hands. In "Adventure," lonely Alice Hindman impulsively walks naked into the night rain. Threaded through the stories is the viewpoint of George Willard, the young newspaper reporter who, like his creator, stands witness to the dark and despairing dealings of a community of isolated people.In 1919 a middle-aged Chicago advertising writer from Ohio, a failure as a businessman, husband, and father, published a slim yellow book of short stories intended to &#34;reform&#34; American literature. Sherwood Anderson strove to portray the buried inner lives of &#34;pathetic grotesques&#34; - people wounded by life in body or spirit - and to tell their stories in short revelations rather than in sweeping novels. Against all expectations, Winesburg Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life accomplished what its author intended. Afterwards, American literature would be written and read differently. Writers of short fiction learned from Anderson to achieve both character-centered form and daring Modernist subject matter. Sherwood Anderson&#39;s Winesburg, Ohio, authorized by the Sherwood Anderson Literary Estate Trust, is an expert text, in that Ray Lewis White has consulted all Anderson manuscripts, typescripts, letters, diaries, and all editions of the book to present the masterpiece as it was intended. White&#39;s edition also is informed by his 35 years of experience in editing, studying, and appreciating Sherwood Anderson and his fiction. New to this edition of Winesburg, Ohio are historical and cultural annotations, documentation of changes of various editions, identification of the Ohio originals of Anderson&#39;s characters; and maps of the real town of Clyde, in North Central Ohio, which was the basis of Anderson&#39;s fictional account. Included as well are unique photographs of Anderson and Clyde that deepen knowledge and feeling for the author&#39;s time and his work.</p><h2>Virginia Woolf: &#34;Orlando: A Biography&#34;, &#34;Mrs.Dalloway&#34;, &#34;To the Lighthouse&#34; (Great Classic Library)</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p></p><h2>Feeling the Shoulder of the Lion: Poems &amp; Teaching Stories from the Mathnawi</h2><p>these selections from the poetry of Rumi express the courage and intensity needed to overcome our ego-imprisonment.

While he is best known for his powerful paintings, he largely ceased painting portraits in 1907 and turned instead to charcoal drawings to satisfy portrait commissions. These drawn portraits represent a substantial, yet often overlooked, part of his practice, and they demonstrate the same sense of immediacy, psychological sensitivity, and mastery of chiaroscuro that animate Sargent&#x2019;s sitters on canvas. This volume presents over sixty superb portrait drawings, showcasing sitters famous for their roles in politics, society, and the arts. It also explores the friendships and the networks of patronage that underpinned Sargent&#x2019;s practice as a portrait draftsman in Edwardian Britain and Progressive Era America.</p><p>Richard Ormond is an outstanding Sargent scholar, as well as well as being the the artist&#x2019;s grand-nephew.

Another feature is the addition of a chapter entitled "On to C++" that prepares readers for a transition to object-oriented programming. <b> </b> The book focuses on many aspects of software engineering, establishing early the connection between good problem-solving skills and effective software development. A five-phase software development method is presented in Chapter 1 and applied in every subsequent case study throughout. The book presents material in an order that meets the needs of a beginning programmer, rather than by the structure of the C programming language. This approach makes it possible to present fundamental concepts using traditional high-level terminology--output parameter, array, array subscript, string--and makes it easier for readers without a prior assembly-language background to master the many facets of pointer usage. <b> </b> This book is designed to introduce C programming to engineers in a way that is relevant to their engineering practice. </p></p><p>Jeri R.

Philosophers present empirical analyses and images in archetypal theories, and the symbolic language of comparative phenomenological theories. Christian, Jewish and Mormon responses to NDEs outline the religious perspective, and the mystical and spiritual interpretations of NDEs are also explored.</p><p>The 24 essays and book excerpts in this volume provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of near-death experience (NDE), including cases and interpretations. Documentation of NDE goes back to the time of Plato and continues to stir public interest on talk shows as people connect by sharing their stories of "coming back from the edge of death." What has happened? Why is it not always a pleasant experience for all people? Why are there the same basic bird's-eye scenarios? Answers come from writers such as Raymond Moody and Betty Eadie, who focus on the spiritual nature of NDE. Carl Jung's psychology of the inner self, based on his NDE, is among the essays' highlights. Additional writings, such as the essay by Karl Jansen, focus on the role of chemicals the brain produces in times of crisis.

For me, a chain of such events began when I checked my e-mail one day in February 2004. Just a few days earlier, a kayaker named Gene Sparling the same man Larry Mallard had told me about a few weeks earlier had spotted an unusual woodpecker foraging on a huge cypress tree in a long, narrow bayou in eastern Arkansas. When he saw the bird&#x2019;s unique color pattern brilliant white on the lower half of its back, with two white lines extending up the back to its crested head he knew immediately that he had never seen this kind of bird before. Inconspicuous in his kayak, he pulled into a secluded spot and sat watching it for almost a full minute. The woodpecker was so close he could see the minute details of the feathers and even some greenish staining on the lower part of its back, perhaps from going in and out of a roost hole or nest.<br> When he got home a few days later, Gene posted a long description of his trip on a canoe club listserver, and he included a couple of sentences about the woodpecker, buried toward the end of the piece. His e- mail report was forwarded to me, and I immediately called him up. I grilled him for about an hour. His sighting sounded better than a lot of the thirty-year- old reports I had been investigating, and it was less than a week old.<br> Gene has pileated woodpeckers nesting on his farm in Hot Springs, in the western part of Arkansas, so he is thoroughly familiar with that species. It seemed unlikely that a pileated was what he had seen. What struck me most about his description was that he said the bird seemed almost cartoonlike because of its quick, jerky movements and general nervousness. Its neck looked thinner than a pileated&#x2019;s, and its crest seemed to come to a point in the back.<br> I telephoned Bobby and told him about the sighting. Then I asked if he would mind calling Gene and talking to him. I was interested in getting his impression, to see if it was the same as mine.<br> After a long talk with Gene, Bobby told him, It sounds to me like you&#x2019;ve seen an ivory-billed woodpecker.&#x201d; You think so?&#x201d; said Gene. I don&#x2019;t have enough confidence to make that call, but I&#x2019;m glad to hear you say that.&#x201d; Before they got off the phone, Bobby was already planning a trip to the sighting area, at Bayou de View in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, and Gene was going to go with him. I mentioned this to my wife about an hour later, and she told me, You should go along with him. You&#x2019;ll never forgive yourself if he sees an ivory-bill and you&#x2019;re not there.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t need much encouragement. I did a quick search on the Internet to find a good airline ticket price and then called up Bobby. Say, you think you could pick me up in Memphis on the way down?&#x201d; No problem,&#x201d; he said. I go right through there.&#x201d; And that was it: the start of our adventure. A week later I was on my way south again, for the second time in a month.<br><br>Gene Sparling told us to meet him on a small country road near Clarendon, Arkansas. He wanted to look at a place where we could haul out at the end of our several-day-long float down the bayou. He had arranged with a local man called Frank to drop us off at a bridge crossing several miles north of where Gene had seen the strange woodpecker and to pick us up at the haul- out point.<br> We spotted Gene&#x2019;s red Toyota pickup, unmistakable with the canoe and kayak strapped to the top, a few minutes after turning off the main road. Gene greeted us enthusiastically, and we stood on the side of the road discussing the bird he had seen and our plans for the next few days.<br> Gene is an affable man with a deep, resonant voice and a slow delivery that reminds me a little of Eeyore&#x2019;s. Grizzled and bearded, with receding red hair and crow&#x2019;s feet etched deeply into his weathered face, he looks older than his forty-eight years.<br>When we finished talking, Gene told us to follow him into Clarendon to pick up Frank.<br> As we drove along behind him, I said to Bobby, You know, he either saw an ivory-bill or he&#x2019;s lying.<br>And I really don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a liar.&#x201d; Bobby nodded. I don&#x2019;t either,&#x201d; he said. His story is completely believable.&#x201d; Gene got confused on the way to Frank&#x2019;s house, and we went driving around and around in a residential area where everything looked the same. He finally found the correct house. Gene leaves his car at Frank&#x2019;s house every time he goes kayaking in this area. On this trip, Bobby parked his oold van in front of Frank&#x2019;s house and left him with the keys.<br> Frank is a large, jovial man of about sixty-five who wears cowboy boots and a leather belt with a huge silver buckle. He teased Gene mercilessly as he drove us to our drop-off point, claiming that Gene must have a she-bear stashed somewhere in the bayou that he was always visiting. No one would come out here just to look at a damn bird,&#x201d; he said. I know you got a she-bear.&#x201d;<br><br>It was bad when Bobby and I first started canoeing along Bayou de View real bad. Without any preparation, we clambered down below the overpass, loaded up the canoe which Gene had borrowed from his parents and pushed off into the latte-brown river flowing into the swamp. I sat in front and Bobby in the stern, with all our equipment piled high between us. I had had some fairly recent experience canoeing in the Adirondacks with my kids, and I had floated to falcon nests in Canada and other far northern places in the past, but I was rusty. Bobby hadn&#x2019;t touched a canoe since he was twelve, and it showed. It was a real grind hauling ourselves through that morass, at times practically clawing our way through the bayou, scrambling up and over logs and cypress knees and blasting through little chutes where the water pushed together to form a swift-moving stream. This is where you&#x2019;re in danger of flipping over. You bump into a submerged log or root, then overreact to compensate, and there you go your canoe has turned over and all your gear and supplies are bobbing downstream as you lie submerged, with brown swamp water rushing into your mouth. Blech!<br> On that first day, it seemed that whenever we found ourselves rushing into a treacherous area, Bobby and I couldn&#x2019;t coordinate our movements to avoid the hazards. I would point the canoe toward the one open passage I could see ahead, but Bobby would inevitably steer in the other direction, and we would wind up blasting sideways into the teeth of disaster. It was the wildest roller coaster ride I&#x2019;ve ever been on. Somehow we managed not to swamp the canoe, but a couple of times I had to jump overboard and horse the canoe in a different direction. Luckily, I was wearing chest waders. Unluckily, the water was sometimes deeper than the top of my waders and came flooding inside.<br><br>Bayou de View is a magical place where wildlife abounds. As we canoed through the swamp, wood ducks and flocks of mallards burst from the water around us. Herds of white-tailed deer, snorting a loud warning, splashed off across the shallow water at the edge of the woods. We saw beavers swimming past and otters playing. The loud calls of barred owls and great horned owls echoed through the dim recesses of the swamp, even at mid- day. But most impressive were the woodpeckers. Everywhere we turned, we saw pileated, red-bellied, red-headed, and downy woodpeckers, plus a few yellow-bellied sapsuckers. It excited us to remember that Jim Tanner had written that the woods in the Singer Tract had the most woodpeckers he had ever seen. This bayou had the same feel.<br>Although on the first day we didn&#x2019;t see any of the huge trees that Gene had described, we passed some massive stumps, remnants of the logging done in the 1800s. And it seemed that there were trees in every state of decomposition, ranging from those that had just a few dying limbs to those that had tumbled to the swamp floor and were rotting away to nothing. It was perfect for woodpeckers, with lots of food and dead trunks and limbs in which to forage and dig roost and nest holes.<br> The three of us found a nice place to camp on some high ground near an area of open water. As I was pitching the tent, though, it began to dawn on me that I would not spend a pleasant night here. I had left home so quickly that I had forgotten to bring my good tent, down sleeping bag, and camp pad. They were packed in a bag back home.<br> I had said to Bobby when we met in Memphis that we should stop at a sporting goods store so I could buy the equipment I would need before we hit the swamp.<br> Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he told me. I&#x2019;ve got an extra tent and sleeping bag in my van.&#x201d; You sure?&#x201d; I asked. It&#x2019;d be no problem to stop and buy some more equipment.&#x201d; No, no,&#x201d; he told me. I&#x2019;ve got everything.&#x201d; I wish I had gone with my instincts. As it turned out, the tent wasn&#x2019;t quite waterproof or bugproof and the sleeping bag had a broken zipper. And it was much colder than I had thought it would be. After sleeping fitfully for a couple of hours, I woke with a start at the nearby splash of a beaver pounding its tail flat on the water right next to us, and I never got back to sleep. No matter what I did with that sleeping bag, the cold air just flooded in, and it was too difficult to get more clothes from my bags in the middle of the night. They were packed securely in the canoe, and I couldn&#x2019;t even find my flashlight. The darkness of that swamp in the middle of the night was like nothing I had ever experienced. I couldn&#x2019;t even see my finger an inch from my eye. So I hunkered in the fetal position and shivered all night.<br> Still, it was great getting up the next morning. Bobby made his classic swamp breakfast, Dinty Moore stew in special waterproof packages for boiling. He put three or four of them at a time into a bubbling cauldron of brown swamp water completely unfit for human consumption, reasoning that the water couldn&#x2019;t get through the pouches to the food. Of course, we would never know if it did, because the stew was about the same color as the water. Gene said that the last time he was here, he had run short of drinking water and had pulled out his special survival water purification straw, but it had clogged up after a few quick sips.<br>He didn&#x2019;t say what the water tasted like it was probably a bit like Dinty Moore stew.<br><br>On the second day of our trip, we passed an area where a long-abandoned railroad trestle, built shortly after the Civil War, cut through the trees. The rails and even the rail bed were long gone, and only stout wooden posts rose up from the swamp water. We were starting to feel as if we were really out in the wilderness, far from civilization.<br>We had been grinding along all morning, and it was tough. Bobby and I tried our best to keep up with Gene, but his kayak was much lighter and more maneuverable than our canoe. He could slip easily through places that presented impossible barriers to us: cypress knees, log jams, tangles of brush and debris. We often had to back up a long way and try a different route, fighting the current back upstream and weaving around obstacles.<br> It was an amazing experience spending time with Gene. He is a remarkable outdoorsman and has spent his life doing things like this hiking, backpacking, horse packing, or kayaking for days or weeks at a time, in areas as close to wilderness as he can find. He used to lead kayak tours in Baja California, paddling out among the gray whales. He now owns a big farm in the mountains near Hot Springs and leads horseback-riding tours.<br> Gene was at his best threading his way stealthily through the bayou in his kayak. He would always range a hundred feet or more in front of us, pulling into little hiding places and sitting silently watching, waiting for something to happen. His patience was boundless, and he had such a low profile in the kayak, he didn&#x2019;t look human. If anything, animals seemed curious when they saw him. We would come along behind him in our canoe and watch wood ducks, beavers, and otters flush from just a few yards in front of him. I had a feeling he would much rather have been out there alone, but he wanted someone to confirm his ivorybill sighting so much that he put up with us.<br><br>Just as we were thinking what a wild place Bayou de View was, we started to hear the loud roar of highway traffic less than a mile downstream. As we approached the bridge at Highway 17, the din from semis was almost unbearable. Bobby told me that whenever he looked down on canoeists while he was driving past on a highway, he always envied them, wishing he could be down there instead of driving. And now here he was, one of the lucky canoe people. The only problem was that it was now a good hour past noon, and he hadn&#x2019;t eaten so much as a Snickers bar since breakfast. Man, we gotta stop soon,&#x201d; he said. I&#x2019;m starving to death.&#x201d; Looking around, I couldn&#x2019;t see any dry spots. The woods up and down the bayou in this area were inundated. Gene said he remembered some places downstream, a little past the highway, where we could stop for lunch. I said that was fine with me.<br>Bobby didn&#x2019;t seem too happy, but we continued on.<br> We paddled the length of the lake&#x201d; south of 17 (it was more like what we would call a pond in New York) and turned right into a narrow channel leading through the trees. Gene had gone well ahead of us and was going to wait for us when he found a good place to stop for lunch. If it seemed that we had gotten lost, he would come looking for us.<br> As we paddled along, we talked and joked about floating through the trackless swamp. Then Bobby started to grouse that we were being way too noisy to see any ivory-bills.<br> We don&#x2019;t need to worry about that,&#x201d; I said. The road&#x2019;s so loud, they&#x2019;ll never hear us coming. And who knows, maybe Gene will chase one back to us.&#x201d; And then it happened. Less than eighty feet away, a large black- and-white bird that had been flying toward us from a side channel of the bayou to the right came out into the sunshine and flew across the open stretch of water directly in front of us. It started to bank, giving us a superb view of its back and both wings for a moment as it pulled up, as if it were going to land on a tree trunk. Look at all the white on its wings!&#x201d; I yelled. Hearing my voice, it veered away from the tree and continued to fly to the left. We both cried out simultaneously, Ivory-bill!&#x201d; Bobby reached for his camcorder while I tried to keep track of the bird. I kept pointing as it flew. I&#x2019;m sure it landed on a tree trunk about fifty feet away, because I lost it for about three seconds, then I had it again, moving in a straight line through the woods, going up the bayou for another fifty or sixty feet, then landing again. It must have hitched around the trunk each time, because I couldn&#x2019;t see it. When we were almost to shore, I caught another glimpse of it flying at the same altitude in the middle of the woods. I lost it after about ten feet.<br> We clambered ashore, dragged the canoe onto the mud, and took off after the ivory-bill, our camcorders running. We staggered through boot- sucking mud and mire, over fallen trees, and through tangled brush and briars. It was impossible to move quietly. We didn&#x2019;t see the bird.<br> About fifteen minutes later we walked back to the canoe, just as Gene was paddling to shore, looking for us. I glanced at my watch. It was 1:30 on February 27, 2004. I said to Bobby that we should sit down separately right away and jot down our field notes, before we had a chance to talk about what we had seen and influence each other. At least we would have some kind of documentary evidence, even if we couldn&#x2019;t get a photograph. (Later, when I was back in Ithaca, Bobby faxed me his field notes and a sketch he had drawn right after seeing the bird; it was virtually identical to my sketch.) My first impression of the bird was that it was defini...</p><h2>John Singer Sargent: Venetian Figures and Landscapes 1898-1913: Complete Paintings: Volume VI</h2><p><p>Throughout his career&#x2015;and particularly in the period from 1898 to 1913&#x2015;John Singer Sargent painted the spectacular architecture and scenes of everyday life in Venice, as he sat alongside the Grand Canal or in a gondola in the sleepy side canals. This lavishly illustrated book presents all the luminous masterworks that Sargent completed during that fertile fifteen-year period: oils and watercolors that reveal his taste for the Renaissance, Baroque, and high style in art and architecture as they were seen in the city&#x2019;s unique light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The book reproduces and documents 141 works, including several that are published for the first time. An authoritative essay explores the aesthetics of Sargent&#x2019;s Venetian work, places it in the context of his oeuvre as a whole, explains Sargent&#x2019;s relationships with his patrons in Venice, and discusses the exhibitions and marketing of this work in London and New York.

This new work is a major contribution to recent debates on the rule of law and the possibilities of democracy in postindustrial societies, but it is much more. The introduction by William Rehg succinctly captures the special nature of the work, noting that it offers a sweeping, sociologically informed conceptualization of law and basic rights, a normative account of the rule of law and the constitutional state, an attempt to bridge normative and empirical approaches to democracy, and an account of the social context required for democracy. Finally, the work frames and caps these arguments with a bold proposal for a new paradigm of law that goes beyond the dichotomies that have afflicted modern political theory from its inception and that still underlie current controversies between so-called liberals and civic republicans. The book includes a postscript written in 1994, which restates the argument in light of its initial reception, and two appendixes, which cover key developments that preceded the book. Habermas himself was actively involved in the translation, adapting the text as necessary to make it more accessible to English-speaking readers.</p></p><p>Jurgen Habermas, an esteemed political philosopher who lived in Germany during the Nazi reign, has produced a thought-provoking work on what he calls &#34;deliberative politics.&#34; To summarize his view, true democracy isn&#39;t just the compilation of opinions or a blanket treatment of majority rules, but a social process in which people meet, discuss, modify and, ultimately, agree. He draws connections between how such a process could shape the making of laws and direct the course of nations. His writings here represent a lifetime of political thought on the nature of democracy and law, and deserve an audience and a place in the foundations of democratic theory.This book works out the legal and political implications of his &#39;Theory of Communicative Action&#39; (1981), bringing to fruition the project announced with his publication of &#39;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&#39; in 1962.

Lately the American Left, withdrawing into the ivied halls of academe to rue the nation's shame, has answered yes in both word and deed. In <i>Achieving Our Country</i>, one of America's foremost philosophers challenges this lost generation of the Left to understand the role it might play in the great tradition of democratic intellectual labor that started with writers like Walt Whitman and John Dewey. </p><p> How have national pride and American patriotism come to seem an endorsement of atrocities--from slavery to the slaughter of Native Americans, from the rape of ancient forests to the Vietnam War? <i>Achieving Our Country</i> traces the sources of this debilitating mentality of shame in the Left, as well as the harm it does to its proponents and to the country. At the center of this history is the conflict between the Old Left and the New that arose during the Vietnam War era. Richard Rorty describes how the paradoxical victory of the antiwar movement, ushering in the Nixon years, encouraged a disillusioned generation of intellectuals to pursue "High Theory" at the expense of considering the place of ideas in our common life. In this turn to theory, Rorty sees a retreat from the secularism and pragmatism championed by Dewey and Whitman, and he decries the tendency of the heirs of the New Left to theorize about the United States from a distance instead of participating in the civic work of shaping our national future. </p><p> In the absence of a vibrant, active Left, the views of intellectuals on the American Right have come to dominate the public sphere. This galvanizing book, adapted from Rorty's Massey Lectures of 1997, takes the first step toward redressing the imbalance in American cultural life by rallying those on the Left to the civic engagement and inspiration needed for "achieving our country." </p></p><p>There are many shameful incidents in America's past: the institution of slavery, genocidal assaults on the indigenous peoples of this continent, the escalation of the Vietnam War, and so on. What should our response to such acts be? Should we regard the nation as irredeemably tainted by sin and spend our time cataloging its evils, or should we acknowledge its shortcomings and make a conscious effort to turn it into a better nation?<p> Philosopher Richard Rorty believes that there is hope for America, but that today's Left is not meeting the challenge. He contrasts the cultural, academic Left's focus on our heritage of shame (which, he admits, has to the extent that it makes hatred intolerable had the positive effect of making America a more civil society) with the politically engaged reformist Left of the early part of this century. "The distinction between the old strategy and the new is important," he writes. "The choice between them makes the difference between what Todd Gitlin calls common dreams and what Arthur Schlesinger calls disuniting Americans. To take pride in being black or gay is an entirely reasonable response to the sadistic humiliation to which one has been subjected. But insofar as this pride prevents someone from also taking pride in being an American citizen, from thinking of his or her country as capable of reform, or from being able to join with straights or whites in reformist initiatives, it is a political disaster."</p><p> Not everyone, to be sure, is going to agree with Rorty's ideas. But his approach to civic life, which is pragmatic in the tradition of John Dewey <i>and</i> visionary in the tradition of Walt Whitman, is bound to provoke increased discussion of what it is to be a citizen, and his call for a renewed awareness of the history of American reformist activism can only be applauded.</p>Must the sins of America&#39;s past poison its hope for the future?

The most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh&#39;s novels, Brideshead Revisited looks back to the golden age before the Second World War. It tells the story of Charles Ryder&#39;s infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian Flyte at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognise his spiritual and social distance from them. &#39;Lush and evocative ... Expresses at once the profundity of change and the indomitable endurance of the human spirit&#39; The Times</p><p>A departure from Evelyn Waugh's normally comic theater, <b>Brideshead Revisited</b> concerns the tale of Charles Ryder, a captain in the British Army in post-World War I England. Unlike Waugh's previous narrators, Ryder is an intelligent man, looking back on much of his life from his current post in Oxford. He strikes a special friendship with Lord Sebastian Flyte as the setting moves to the Brideshead estate and a baroque castle that recalls England's prior standing in the world. Ryder falls for Flyte's sister while families, politics and religions collide. What makes the book extraordinary is Waugh's sharp, vivid style and his use of dialect and minor characters.

Our native country is Omnipresence. On earth we are but travelers-guests on a brief visit." </p><p>"Unfortunately, most people make undesirable guests of themselves! They insist on monopolizing a small portion of this earth as their very own. Their constant thought is 'my home, my wife, my husband, my children.' Material entanglements, sweet and mysterious, keep them dreaming through the sleep of delusion. They forget who and what they really are. </p><p>"Wake up! before your dream of life vanishes into the infinite. When this body drops in death, where will your family be? your home? your money? You are not this body. The body is only a plate, given to you that you might eat from it the feast of spirit. </p><p>"Why not learn this essential lesson before death? Why wait? Don't tie yourself to the limitations of human consciousness, but remember the vastness of the spirit within."</p></p><h2>Lenses: Applying Lifespan Development Theories in Counseling</h2><p>Lenses offers a current and practical review of human development perspectives and theories, a subject that is often critically under-represented in graduate courses.

She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>Workbook in Latin Two Years</h2><p>Excellent teaching and learning resource!</p><p></p><h2>Mitzvah Girls: Bringing Up the Next Generation of Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn</h2><p><p><i>Mitzvah Girls</i> is the first book about bringing up Hasidic Jewish girls in North America, providing an in-depth look into a closed community. Ayala Fader examines language, gender, and the body from infancy to adulthood, showing how Hasidic girls in Brooklyn become women responsible for rearing the next generation of nonliberal Jewish believers. To uncover how girls learn the practices of Hasidic Judaism, Fader looks beyond the synagogue to everyday talk in the context of homes, classrooms, and city streets.</p><br><p> Hasidic women complicate stereotypes of nonliberal religious women by collapsing distinctions between the religious and the secular. In this innovative book, Fader demonstrates that contemporary Hasidic femininity requires women and girls to engage with the secular world around them, protecting Hasidic men and boys who study the Torah. Even as Hasidic religious observance has become more stringent, Hasidic girls have unexpectedly become more fluent in secular modernity. They are fluent Yiddish speakers but switch to English as they grow older; they are increasingly modest but also fashionable; they read fiction and play games like those of mainstream American children but theirs have Orthodox Jewish messages; and they attend private Hasidic schools that freely adapt from North American public and parochial models. Investigating how Hasidic women and girls conceptualize the religious, the secular, and the modern, <i>Mitzvah Girls</i> offers exciting new insights into cultural production and change in nonliberal religious communities.</p></p><p><p>"This is a superb book. All manner of readers will find themselves moved by this beautifully rendered portrait of the process by which Hasidic girls become Hasidic women. Scholars of language, gender, and religion will find something more--a theoretically innovative synthesis of work on language socialization and the anthropology of morality that points toward whole new areas of study. Put simply, it is one of the most exciting works on religion I have read in some years."<b>--Joel Robbins, University of California, San Diego</b></p><p>"<i>Mitzvah Girls</i> is impressive in its sweep, tackling the considerable topic of how religious communities are sustained and changed. Ayala Fader transcends simple language and culture alignments to bring readers into the usually inaccessible private worlds of Hasidic families. I know of no other book that monitors socialization into gender from childhood to adulthood, while examining how language frames the formation of secular antipathies, adherence to divine legitimacy, self-control, and nostalgia for a lost Hasidic past."<b>--Elinor Ochs, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"<i>Mitzvah Girls</i> is fresh and fascinating. It is exemplary not only because of the exceptionally fine ethnographic research, but also because of the highly original approach to language, body, and culture. Fader illuminates aspects of contemporary Hasidic life that have never been explored before in ways that speak to larger questions: the place of women in male-centered religions, the gendering of language, and the forms that modernity takes in a world that values tradition."<b>--Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, author of <i>Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage</i></b></p><p>"With insightful and carefully drawn analysis, <i>Mitzvah Girls</i> challenges how Hasidim and other fundamentalist communities are often regarded from the outside. Fader presents a nuanced look at how both Yiddish and English are gendered in the daily lives of American Hasidic girls and women. This book makes a valuable contribution to the scholarship on American Hasidism, American Judaism more generally, contemporary Jewish language use, women's religious life, and religious fundamentalism."<b>--Jeffrey Shandler, author of <i>Adventures in Yiddishland: Postvernacular Language and Culture</i></b></p><b>Ayala Fader</b> is assistant professor of anthropology at Fordham University, Lincoln Center.</p><h2>How Novels Work</h2><p>Drawing on his weekly <em>Guardian</em> column, "Elements of Fiction," John Mullan offers an engaging look at the novel, focusing mostly on works of the last ten years as he illuminates the rich resources of novelistic technique.<br><br>Mullan sheds light on some of the true masterworks of contemporary fiction, including Monica Ali's <em>Brick Lane</em>, J.M. Coetzee's <em>Disgrace</em>, Don DeLillo's <em>Underworld</em>, Jonathan Franzen's <em>The Corrections</em>, Mark Haddon's <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>, Patricia Highsmith's <em>Ripley under</em> <em>Ground</em>, Ian McEwan's <em>Atonement</em>, John le Carr�'s <em>The Constant Gardener</em>, Philip Roth's <em>The Human Stain</em>, Jonathan Safran Foer's <em>Everything Is Illuminated</em>, and Zadie Smith's <em>White Teeth</em>. He highlights how these acclaimed authors use some of the basic elements of fiction. Some topics (like plot, dialogue, or location) will appear familiar to most novel readers, while others (meta-narrative, prolepsis, amplification) will open readers' eyes to new ways of understanding and appreciating the writer's craft. Mullan also excels at comparing modern and classic authors--Nick Hornby's adoption of a female narrator is compared to Daniel Defoe's; Ian McEwan's use of weather is set against Austen's and Hardy's.<br><em></em> How Novels Work explains how the pleasures of novel reading often come from the formal ingenuity of the novelist, making visible techniques and effects we are often only half-aware of as we read. It is an entertaining and stimulating volume that will captivate anyone who is interested in the contemporary or the classical novel.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Mullan</strong> is Professor of English at University College London. He is the author of <em>Sentiment and Sociability: The Language of Feeling in the Eighteenth Century</em> and co-editor of <em>Eighteenth-Century Popular Culture: An Anthology</em>. A broadcaster and journalist as well as an academic, he writes a weekly column on contemporary fiction for the <em>Guardian</em>.<br>Based on Mullan's weekly "Elements of Fiction" column from UK's The Guardian, this volume intelligently dismantles a hefty stack of beloved novels to find out what makes them tick. Mullan is interested in fiction that most resonates with contemporary audiences-the books that readers remember and are eager to share and discuss-and, consequently, a number of book-club favorites turn up here, including Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections and Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nightime. Moving with critical dexterity from Martin Amis to Richard Yates to Virginia Woolf to a small library of other well-known authors, Mullan's methods-which are, in effect, to claw at the ineffable qualities of modern-day classics until some concrete observations emerge-are consistently readable and relevant, illuminating well each chapter's topic (Genre, Voices, Structure, Detail and Style among them). Although Mullan notes in the introduction that he revised, rearranged, and rewrote the columns extensively, the book retains-to its benefit-a serial, journalistic feel, moving the ambitious project from topic to topic and book to book at a pace that allows for real mechanical investigation but bars stalling.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847. </p> <p> Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound. </p> <p> The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Holt McDougal Larson Geometry, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Wraparound style, with student pages reproduced in small font inside teacher ediiton</p><p></p><h2>Book Yourself Solid: Second Edition, Revised &amp; Expanded</h2><p>The new edition of the bestselling business development guide <p><i>Book Yourself Solid, Second Edition</i> reveals why self-promotion is a critical factor to success, giving you a unique perspective that makes this guide much more than an ordinary "how to" manual for getting more clients and raising a business profile.</p> <p><i>Book Yourself Solid, Second Edition</i> enables you to adopt the right promotional perspective and provides the strategies, techniques, and skills necessary to get more clients and increase profits.

Evidence from the best-known Western writers and artists of the post-Civil War period - Owen Wister, Mark Twain, Frederic Remington, George Catlin - as well as now-forgotten writers, illustrators, and photographers, suggest that in the period before the word &#39;homosexual&#39; and its synonyms were invented, same-sex intimacy and erotic admiration were key aspects of a masculine code. These males-only clubs of journalists, cowboys, miners, Indian vaqueros defined themselves by excluding femininity and the cloying ills of domesticity, while embracing what Roosevelt called &#39;strenuous living&#39; with other bachelors in the relative &#39;purity&#39; of wilderness conditions. Queer Cowboys recovers this forgotten culture of exclusively masculine, sometimes erotic, and often intimate camaraderie in fiction, photographs, illustrations, song lyrics, historical ephemera, and theatrical performances.</p><p>"A searching and original study.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings.

Studded with anecdotes and based on previously untapped archives, this first biography of Lawson brings alive his era and features many of his prominent friends and associates, including John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Chaplin, Gene Kelly, Edmund Wilson, Ernest Hemingway, Humphrey Bogart, Dalton Trumbo, Ring Lardner, Jr., and many others. Lawson's life becomes a prism through which we gain a clearer perspective on the evolution and machinations of McCarthyism and anti-Semitism in the United States, on the influence of the left on Hollywood, and on a fascinating man whose radicalism served as a foil for launching the political careers of two Presidents: Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

Its stylistic brilliance demonstrates the appropriateness of St John&#39;s enduring title, the golden-mouthed. Yet the rhetorical eloquence of the work is not simply camouflage for lack of substance. As Graham Neville observes in his Introduction, Chrysostom had a mind both practical and idealistic, that brought into close connection the evils and injustices of the world and the perfection of moral life demanded by the gospel.

It&#39;s no wonder that the media refers to it grandly as the &#34;God particle.&#34; Yet behind closed doors, physicists are admitting that there is much more to this story, and even years of gunning the Large Hadron Collider and herculean number crunching may still not lead to a deep understanding of the laws of nature. In this fascinating and eye-opening account, theoretical physicist Alexander Unzicker and science writer Sheilla Jones offer a polemic. They question whether the large-scale, multinational enterprises actually lead us to the promised land of understanding the universe. The two scientists take us on a tour of contemporary physics and show how a series of highly publicized theories met a dead end. Unzicker and Jones systematically unpack the recent hot theories such as &#34;parallel universes,&#34; &#34;string theory,&#34; and &#34;inflationary cosmology,&#34; and provide an accessible explanation of each. They argue that physics has abandoned its evidence-based roots and shifted to untestable mathematical theories, and they issue a clarion call for the science to return to its experimental foundation.</p><p><p>Alexander Unzicker is a German theoretical physicist and neuroscientist. </p><p>Sheilla Jones is the author of <i>The Quantum Ten</i> and an award-winning Canadian journalist and a science contributor to CBC.

How does the struggle for power and money among modern scientists compromise the quest for uncovering the true secrets of nature?

The bad news is that they don't have a pool. The good news is that only one of them can swim anyway. Bestselling author Chris Crutcher&#x2019;s controversial and acclaimed novel follows a group of outcasts as they take on inequality and injustice in their high school. </p><p>"Crutcher's superior gifts as a storyteller and his background as a working therapist combine to make magic in <em>Whale Talk</em>.

They may not have very much talent, but the All-Night Mermen prove to be way more than T.J. anticipated. As the unlikely athletes move closer to their goal, these new friends might learn that the journey is worth more than the reward.

J. Jones is black, Japanese, and white; his given name is The Tao (honest!), and he's the son of a woman who abandoned him when she got heavily into crack and crank. As a child he was full of rage, but now as a senior in high school he's pretty much overcome all that. With the help of a good therapist and his decent, loving, ex-hippie adoptive parents, he's not only fairly even-keeled, he has turned out to be smart and funny. <p> Injustice, however, still fills him with fury. So when big-deal football star Mike Barbour bullies brain-damaged Chris Coughlin for wearing his dead brother's letter jacket, T.J. hatches a scheme for revenge. He assembles a swim team (in a school with no pool) made up of the most outrageous outsiders and misfits he can find and extracts a conditional promise of those sacred letter jackets from the coach. After weeks of dedicated practice at the All Night Fitness pool, the seven mermen get good enough not to embarrass themselves in competition. The really important thing, though, turns out to be the long bus rides to meets, a safe place to share the hurts that have made them who they are. Meanwhile, T.J.'s father, who has taken in a battered little girl to ease his lifelong guilt over his role in the accidental death of a baby, tangles with another bully--her stepfather--and his growing murderous rage. </p><p> Chris Crutcher, therapist and author of seven prize-winning young adult books, here gives his many fans another wise and compassionate story full of the intensity of athletic competition and hair-raising incidents of child abuse. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>There?s bad news and good news about the Cutter High School swim team. The bad news is that they don?t have a pool. The good news is that only one of them can swim anyway. A group of misfits brought together by T. J. Jones (the J is redundant), the Cutter All Night Mermen struggle to find their places in a school that has no place for them. T.J. is convinced that a varsity letter jacket?exclusive, revered, the symbol (as far as T.J. is concerned) of all that is screwed up at Cutter High?will also be an effective tool. He?s right. He?s also wrong. Still, it?s always the quest that counts. And the bus on which the Mermen travel to swim meets soon becomes the space where they gradually allow themselves to talk, to fit, to grow. Together they?ll fight for dignity in a world where tragedy and comedy dance side by side, where a moment?s inattention can bring lifelong heartache, and where true acceptance is the only prescription for what ails us.</p><h2>College Algebra Demystified</h2><p><b>A BETTER WAY TO COLLEGE ALGEBRA X-PERTISE</b> <p> One of the most valuable tools acquired in a university education, college algebra is essential for courses from the sciences to computing, engineering to mathematics.

How did the postwar discourse on development actually create the so-called Third World? And what will happen when development ideology collapses? To answer these questions, Arturo Escobar shows how development policies became mechanisms of control that were just as pervasive and effective as their colonial counterparts. The development apparatus generated categories powerful enough to shape the thinking even of its occasional critics while poverty and hunger became widespread. "Development" was not even partially "deconstructed" until the 1980s, when new tools for analyzing the representation of social reality were applied to specific "Third World" cases. Here Escobar deploys these new techniques in a provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general, concluding with a discussion of alternative visions for a postdevelopment era.</p><br><p> Escobar emphasizes the role of economists in development discourse--his case study of Colombia demonstrates that the economization of food resulted in ambitious plans, and more hunger. To depict the production of knowledge and power in other development fields, the author shows how peasants, women, and nature became objects of knowledge and targets of power under the "gaze of experts."</p><br><p> In a substantial new introduction, Escobar reviews debates on globalization and postdevelopment since the book's original publication in 1995 and argues that the concept of postdevelopment needs to be redefined to meet today's significantly new conditions. He then calls for the development of a field of "pluriversal studies," which he illustrates with examples from recent Latin American movements.</p></p><p><p>"An intelligent and thorough overview of the rise of the concept of 'development' . . . .

Robert M. Dowling innovatively recounts O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s life in four acts, thus highlighting how the stories he told for the stage interweave with his actual life stories. Each episode also uncovers how O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s work was utterly intertwined with, and galvanized by, the culture and history of his time.<br><br> Much is new in this extensively researched book: connections between O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s plays and his political and philosophical worldview; insights into his Irish upbringing and lifelong torment over losing faith in God; his vital role in African American cultural history; unpublished photographs, including a unique offstage picture of him with his lover Louise Bryant; new evidence of O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s desire to become a novelist and what this reveals about his unique dramatic voice; and a startling revelation about the release of <i>Long Day&#x2019;s Journey Into Night </i>in defiance of his explicit instructions.

Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The exhilaration that comes from reading Adam Bede Owes its existence to the fact that on every page George Eliot seems absorbed in the process of spiritual discovery. The evocations of bygone rural life for which Adam Bede was so resoundingly praised on its publication in 1859 are charged with a personal passion that intensifies the novel&#39;s outer dramas of seduction and betrayal, and inner dramas of moral growth and redemption.</p><h2>Drowned City: Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans (Ala Notable Children&#39;s Books.

Eighty percent of the city flooded, in some places under twenty feet of water. Property damages across the Gulf Coast topped $100 billion. One thousand eight hundred and thirty-three people lost their lives. The riveting tale of this historic storm and the drowning of an American city is one of selflessness, heroism, and courage&#x2014;and also of incompetence, racism, and criminality.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don Brown&#x2019;s kinetic art and as-it-happens narrative capture both the tragedy and triumph of one of the worst natural disasters in American history. A portion of the proceeds from this book has been donated to Habitat for Humanity New Orleans.</p></p><p><p><b>Don Brown</b> is the award-winning author and illustrator of many picture book biographies. He has been widely praised for his resonant storytelling and his delicate watercolor paintings that evoke the excitement, humor, pain, and joy of lives lived with passion. <i>School Library Journal</i> has called him "a current pacesetter who has put the finishing touches on the standards for storyographies." He lives in New York with his family.</p><p>www.booksbybrown.com</p><p>Instagram: @donsart</p>Gr 7 Up&#x2014;A murky watercolor storm spreads across pages, darkening and becoming more ominous as it builds in Brown's deeply affecting look at Hurricane Katrina. Dynamic sketches capture shocking scenes, such as residents fleeing down claustrophobic highways as the 400-mile-wide storm looms in a nearly completely dark spread. Brown depicts broken levees, flooded homes, and inhabitants scrabbling to not drown in their attics. A stunningly powerful spread shows water everywhere and two lone people trapped on a roof. The images demonstrate the utter devastation and despair while the at times spare text powerfully reveals the voices of the victims. The many failures of President Bush, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mayor Ray Nagin, and others are repeatedly noted, as is the heroism of various organizations and ordinary people. Brown walks readers through the ghastly conditions at the Superdome, the horrors of hospitals with no electricity, and the nightmarish reality of dead bodies everywhere. The story becomes grimmer at every turn: ineffectual police and rescue efforts, looting, the lack of housing for rescued victims, and 5,000 missing children. The muted watercolors effectively capture the squalid and treacherous conditions of every inch of New Orleans. The final pages show the rebuilding efforts but note the lasting effects of vastly decreased populations. VERDICT This astonishingly powerful look at one of America's worst disasters is a masterful blend of story and art and a required purchase for all libraries.&#x2014;Amanda MacGregor, Great River Regional Library, St. Cloud, MN</p><h2>A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918</h2><p>"An impressive achievement in a task of extraordinary difficulty...The outstanding asset of this work does not consist in in its comprehensiveness and objectivity, however, nor even in the wide knowledge and special expertise Kann can bring to bear from his early legal training, his formidable scholarship on the nationalities question, and his keen critical appreciation of the diverse cultures of the monarchy. Its greatest merit derives from the author's determination always to ask fundamental questions, his care to discriminate between surface phenomena and deeper causes, his skill in finding significant patterns in an apparently chaotic welter of events, his facility for perceptive and penetrating distinctions and generalizations. In short, he tried with considerable success to tell what <i>really</i> happened in history rather than simply what obviously happened."&#x2014;<i>Canadian Historical Review</i></p><p></p><h2>Managerial Economics (The Mcgraw-hill Economics Series)</h2><p>The goal of Thomas and Maurice's <i>Managerial Economics</i> is to teach students the economic way of thinking about business decision and strategy.

While maintaining a rigorous style, this book is designed to be one of the most accessible books in managerial economics from which to teach and learn because of its clarity of presentation and strong end of chapter problems. Rather than parading students quickly through every interesting or new topic in microeconomics and industrial organization, this 12th edition instead carefully develops and applies the most useful concepts for business decision making and strategic planning.</p></p><p>Professor Emeritus of Economics at Texas A&amp;M University.

Love isn&#39;t always at first sight. When Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr Darcy, it&#39;s fair to say he doesn&#39;t make the best first impression. Arrogant, condescending and aloof, he is everything the spirited and clever Elizbeth despises - and that&#39;s before he breaks her sister&#39;s heart. But why, then, do her thoughts turn to him again and again? Slowly, Elizabeth starts to realise that her first impression may have been wrong. But by then, it might just be too late!</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Posner offers in this new book a unique and, to orthodox legal thinkers, a startling perspective on how judges and justices decide cases. When conventional legal materials enable judges to ascertain the true facts of a case and apply clear pre-existing legal rules to them, Posner argues, they do so straightforwardly; that is the domain of legalist reasoning. However, in non-routine cases, the conventional materials run out and judges are on their own, navigating uncharted seas with equipment consisting of experience, emotions, and often unconscious beliefs. In doing so, they take on a legislative role, though one that is confined by internal and external constraints, such as professional ethics, opinions of respected colleagues, and limitations imposed by other branches of government on freewheeling judicial discretion. Occasional legislators, judges are motivated by political considerations in a broad and sometimes a narrow sense of that term. In that open area, most American judges are legal pragmatists. Legal pragmatism is forward-looking and policy-based. It focuses on the consequences of a decision in both the short and the long term, rather than on its antecedent logic. Legal pragmatism so understood is really just a form of ordinary practical reasoning, rather than some special kind of legal reasoning. </p><p> Supreme Court justices are uniquely free from the constraints on ordinary judges and uniquely tempted to engage in legislative forms of adjudication. More than any other court, the Supreme Court is best understood as a political court. </p></p><p>From the book: Ivan Karamazov said that if God does not exist everything is permitted, and traditional legal thinkers are likely to say that if legalism (legal formalism, orthodox legal reasoning, a &#34;government of laws not men,&#34; the &#34;rule of law&#34; as celebrated in the loftiest &#34;Law Day&#34; rhetoric, and so forth) does not exist everything is permitted to judges--so watch out! Legalism does exist, and so not everything is permitted. But its kingdom has shrunk and greyed to the point where today it is largely limited to routine cases, and so a great deal is permitted to judges. Just how much is permitted and how they use their freedom are the principal concerns of this book. . . . I am struck by how unrealistic are the conceptions of the judge held by most people, including practicing lawyers and eminent law professors, who have never been judges--and even by some judges. This unrealism is due to a variety of things, including the different perspectives of the different branches of the legal profession--including also a certain want of imagination. It is also due to the fact that most judges are cagey, even coy, in discussing what they do. They tend to parrot an official line about the judicial process (how rule-bound it is), and often to believe it, though it does not describe their actual practices. This book parts the curtain a bit.<p>Richard A.

DesJardins's unique approach encompasses all that an introductory business ethics course is, from a multidisciplinary perspective. It offers critical analysis and integrates the perspective of philosophy with management, law, economics, and public policy, providing a clear, concise, yet reasonably comprehensive introductory survey of the ethical choices available to us in business.</p><p>Joe DesJardins is Professor in the philosophy department formed jointly by the College of St. Benedict and St. John&#x2019;s University in Minnesota. He presently serves as the Executive Director of the Society for Business Ethics. Among his publications are: <i>An Introduction to Business Ethics</i> (McGraw Hill), <i>Environmental Ethics: An Introduction to Environmental Philosophy</i> (Wadsworth), of <i>Contemporary Issues in Business Ethics</i>, co-editor, with John McCall, (5th Ed, Wadsworth) , and the forthcoming <i>Business, Ethics, and Sustainability: Ethics for the Next Industrial Revolution</i> (Prentice Hall).

Prospero, exiled Duke of Milan, living on an enchanted island, has the opportunity to punish and forgive his enemies when he raises a tempest that drives them ashore&#x2014;as well as to forestall a rebellion, to arrange the meeting of his daughter, Miranda, with an eminently suitable young prince, and, more important, to relinquish his magic powers in recognition of his advancing age. Richly filled with music and magic, romance and comedy, the play's theme of love and reconciliation offers a splendid feast for the senses and the heart.</p><p>The Tempest is one of Shakespeare&#39;s most suggestive, yet most elusive plays. It is a magical romance, yet deeply embedded in seventeenth-century debates about authority and power. This edition attends to the implications of Prospero&#39;s magic, his political and paternal ambitions, and the controversial issue of his &#39;colonialist&#39; control of Caliban. The Tempest was also Shakespeare&#39;s response to the new opportunities offered by the Blackfriars theatre, and careful attention is given to the play&#39;s dramatic form, stage-craft, and use of music and spectacle, to demonstrate its uniquely experimental nature.The general editors of the new series of forty-two volumes -- renowned Shakespeareans Stephen Orgel of Stanford University and A. R. Braunmuller of UCLA -- have assembled a team of six eminent scholars who have, along with the general editors themselves, prepared new introductions and notes to all of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems. Redesigned in an easy-to-read format that preserves the favorite features of the original - -and including an essay on the theatrical world of Shakespeare, an introduction to the individual play, and a note on the text used -- the new Pelican Shakespeare will be an excellent resource for students, teachers, and theater professionals well into the twenty-first century.</p><h2>Investment Psychology Explained: Classic Strategies to Beat the Markets</h2><p>Expert advice in a back-to-basics handbook on how to beat the market-the classic way<br> <br> In Investment Psychology Explained Martin J.

The cruel and terrible Kali is thought to be born of wild, aboriginal roots. She is the goddess of thieves and often associated with human blood sacrifice. Krsna, in contrast, is the divine lover and inimitable prankster who plays a bewitching flute to draw all to him. But Kali and Krsna have much more in common than their contrasting personalities suggest. Kinsley shows that Krsna's flute can be interchangeable with Kali's sword, revealing important perceptions of the divine in the Hindu tradition.</p><p><b>David R.

Mr. Lewis teaches illustration at Philadelphia's University of the Arts, and is a member of the Society of Illustrators. He lives in Folsom, New Jersey.*Starred Review* In perhaps his most powerful effort to date, Lewis illustrates the classic Langston Hughes poem named in this beautiful picture book&#x2019;s title. Each spread&nbsp;pairs a line of poetry with&nbsp;soaring watercolor artwork. Like the poem, the images celebrate African American strength through generations, and each picture is both timeless and weighted with history. In the picture accompanying&nbsp;the line &#x201c;I heard the singing of the Mississippi,&#x201d; a man springs from the muddy water, while a nineteenth-century steamboat passing on the far shore sets the image in time and opens up deeper questions about the man&#x2019;s place in the world: is he&nbsp;free?&nbsp;Some scenes are literal: on a jungle riverbank, a mother holds her dozing child next to the line &#x201c;I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.&#x201d; Others are powerful visual metaphors: brown hands hold a brown earthen water jug under the words &#x201c;older than the flow of human blood in human veins.&#x201d; Lewis&#x2019; dramatic, expertly modulated fluctuations between light and dark evoke the poem&#x2019;s dichotomies of celebration and sorrow, the spiritual and the material worlds,&nbsp;and the single soul that follows millions of ancestors. Even if children don&#x2019;t grasp the meaning in every line, they&#x2019;ll easily connect with these luminous, soul-stirring pictures that honor both African American heritage and the whole human family. Transcendent images for a transcendent poem.

The addition of this book is a must for all upper-level Christian school curricula and for college students and adults interested in math or related fields of science and religion. It will serve as a solid refutation for the claim, often made in court, that mathematics is one subject, which cannot be taught from a distinctively Biblical perspective.</p><p></p><h2>The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour</h2><p>Humans have lived with cats for thousands of years, and there are now more cats kept in Western households than any other animal. Cherished as companions and valued as rodent catchers, their enigmatic behavior has intrigued and bewildered us for generations. While accepting the comforts of human homes, cats do seem to &#34;walk by themselves.&#34; Although loved for their independence and self-reliance, myths and fables surround them, leaving them open to persecution and misunderstanding. Covering all types of cats from pampered pets to feral hunters, this completely revised new edition of The Domestic Cat shows how cats live and behave in a variety of circumstances and surroundings. With new chapters on welfare issues, and cat-cat communication, this volume penetrates the enigma that is Felis catus, sorting fact from fiction, and helping both the general reader and the specialist in animal behavior or veterinary science to understand cats as they really are.</p><p>Cats are cherished as companions and valued as rodent catchers, but their enigmatic behaviour has intrigued us for generations.

This Bible commentary provides explanation, background, and application for every verse in the book of Revelation.</p><p>Revelation is a book about the future and about the present. It offers future hope to all believers, especially those who have suffered for their faith. Revelation proclaims Christ&#39;s total triumph over evil and the reality of eternal life with him. It also gives guidance for the present as it teaches us about Jesus Christ and how we should live for him now. Through graphic word pictures we learn that Jesus Christ is coming again, that the forces of evil will be judged, and that the dead will be raised to judgment, headed for either eternal life or eternal destruction. As you read Revelation, look beyond the symbols to your sovereign God and to your Savior, Jesus Christ. And take hope-his victory is sure!</p><h2>Positive Discipline Tools for Teachers: Effective Classroom Management for Social, Emotional, and Academic Success</h2><p><p>MORE THAN 2 MILLION POSITIVE DISCIPLINE BOOKS SOLD<br><br>The Positive Discipline method has proved to be an invaluable resource for teachers who want to foster creative problem-solving within their students, giving them the behavioral skills they need to understand and process what they learn.

Students have a reason for doing what they do. Adler called it &#x201c;private logic.&#x201d; A student&#x2019;s behavior may not make sense to us, but it makes sense to him or her. In Positive Discipline we teach adults to be &#x201c;behavior detectives&#x201d; by trying to understand the belief behind the behavior.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to channel your inner detective and start reading the signals that your students are sending you. This means that you will be a teacher whose energy is focused on following clues to discover the belief behind a student&#x2019;s behavior, rather than a teacher focused on needlessly punishing unacceptable behavior. It means you will use your best teaching skills to encourage a student to develop a new belief and a new behavior.<br><br>The Mistaken Goal Chart (page 12) and the Mistaken Goal Detective Clue Form (page 11) help you become a master behavior detective. Use them to solve the mystery of how to encourage a challenging student.<br><br>Mistaken Goal Detective Clue Form<br><br>1.Think of a recent challenge you had with a student. Write it down. Describe what occurred as though you are writing a script: What did your student do? How did you react? What happened next?<br><br>2.What were you feeling when you were in the middle of this challenge? (Choose a feeling from Column 2 of the Mistaken Goal Chart.) Write it down.<br><br>3.Now move your finger over to Column 3 of the Mistaken Goal Chart to see if your behavior, as you described it in your challenge, comes close to any of these typical adult responses. If what you did is described better in a different row, double-check to see if there is a feeling in another row in Column 2 that better represents how you were feeling at a deeper level. (For example, we often say we are feeling annoyed when, at a deeper level, we are feeling challenged or hurt, or we might say we feel hopeless and helpless when we really feel challenged or defeated in a power struggle.) How you react is a clue to your deeper feelings.<br><br>4.Move your finger across to Column 4. Do any of these descriptions come close to what the child did in response to your reaction?<br><br>5.Now move your finger back to Column 1 of the Mistaken Goal Chart. It is likely that this is your child&#x2019;s mistaken goal. Write it down.<br><br>6.Move your finger to the right, to Column 5. You have just discovered what may be the discouraging belief that is the basis for the student&#x2019;s mistaken goal. Write it down.<br><br>7.Move your finger to Column 6. Does this come close to a belief you have that may contribute to the student&#x2019;s misbehavior? (Remember, this is not about blame, only about awareness.) While you are learning skills to encourage the student, you will also change your own belief! Try it now by writing down a response that would be more encouraging to your student. You&#x2019;ll find clues in the last two columns.<br><br>8.Move your finger to Column 7, where you will find the coded message the child is sending about what he or she needs in order to feel encouraged.<br><br>9.Move once more to Column 8, the last one, to find some ideas you could try the next time the student presents this challenging behavior. You can also use your own wisdom to think of what to do or say that would speak to the coded message in Column 7. Write down your plan.<br><br>10.How did it go? Record in your journal exactly what you discovered and what happened. Did the student&#x2019;s behavior change? Did yours? If your plan isn&#x2019;t successful the first time, try another tool. Make certain that in every effort you begin by making a connection before you attempt a correction.<br><br>Another way to discern mistaken goals is to use what Dreikurs called &#x201c;goal disclosure.&#x201d; The Mistaken Goal Chart may not include a particular student&#x2019;s belief, but it can help you make informed and helpful guesses about what the motivating belief may be. The goal disclosure process can help you confirm your guesses in a way that creates a connection with the student, because it provides the deepest form of empathy: helping the student feel deeply understood.<br><br>Goal Disclosure<br><br>Wait for a calm time (not during conflict) to talk with a student in private. A friendly atmosphere is essential. Ask the student for permission to make guesses about why he or she is behaving in a certain way. Let the student know that he or she can tell you if you have guessed correctly or not. (This is usually an intriguing challenge to the student.) Ask the questions below, one at a time. If after any question you get a yes or a recognition reflex (for example, a spontaneous smile even while saying no&#x2014;the no is an automatic denial, while the smile suggests that the student has subconsciously gained a deeper understanding of herself), you can follow up with plans for the student to get her needs met in ways that are positive and empowering. If no clarifying response to a question occurs, go on to the next question.<br><br>1.&#x201c;Could it be that you do this particular behavior to get my attention?&#x201d; (Undue Attention)<br><br>2.&#x201c;Could it be that you want to show me I can&#x2019;t make you do as I ask?&#x201d; (Misguided Power)<br><br>3.&#x201c;Could it be that you feel hurt and want to hurt back?&#x201d; (Revenge)<br><br>4.&#x201c;Could it be you believe you can&#x2019;t succeed and want to be left alone?&#x201d; (Assumed Inadequacy)<br><br>Here are some effective responses if the student responds with a yes (or a recognition reflex) to a question indicating a specific goal.<br><br>1.Undue Attention: &#x201c;Everyone wants attention. There are encouraging ways and discouraging ways to get attention. Would you be willing to work with me on a plan for you to get attention in ways that are positive and encouraging to others as well as yourself, such as a morning greeter?&#x201d;<br><br>2.Misguided Power: &#x201c;Power can be used in encouraging ways or discouraging ways. I would appreciate your help in using your power in ways that are useful to yourself and the whole class. Would you be willing to lead our class meeting tomorrow, or would you like to be a tutor in one of the lower grades for a student who needs some help?&#x201d;<br><br>3.Revenge: &#x201c;I can see that you are feeling hurt. I&#x2019;m so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?&#x201d; When the mistaken goal is Revenge, validating hurt feelings is often enough to invite behavior change. If it doesn&#x2019;t seem that validation is enough, follow up by saying, &#x201c;Would you like to get together again tomorrow to see if we can figure out some ways to find a solution to this challenge?&#x201d;<br><br>4.Assumed Inadequacy: &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t give up on you. I care too much. We&#x2019;ll do whatever it takes to help you succeed. Let me show you some small steps to help you get started.&#x201d; (For example, if the child is having trouble drawing a circle, say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll draw the first half of the circle, and you can draw the second half.&#x201d; This technique can be effective with whatever learning task the student is struggling with.)<br><br>Goal disclosure can be a powerful tool. When the teacher&#x2019;s empathy is genuine, the student experiences a connection with the teacher that is deeply caring. Goal disclosure will help you better understand your student, and your student will gain valuable insights about his or her deeper needs and motivations.<br><br>A teacher&#x2019;s friendly demeanor during goal disclosure demonstrates how much he or she cares. Because effective goal disclosure includes authentic empathy from the teacher and a new sense of connection for the student, the process will increase the student&#x2019;s feeling of belonging and contribution. Remember, when belonging and contribution increase, misbehavior decreases.<br><br>tool in action from kowloon, hong kong<br><br>Alex is an eight-year-old boy. He is very intelligent, but he cannot make friends at school. Most of the girls just walk away from him. Most of the boys fight with him. Refusing to follow instructions from teachers or parents is a big issue for Alex. He will avoid participation when he has no interest in a subject. The PE teacher has a very hard time calming him down when he interrupts the class because he wants to avoid group participation. He is very good at math and science, but when he finishes assigned tasks early and is bored, he becomes disruptive. He told me that he understands his behaviors are not acceptable sometimes, but he cannot control his emotions.<br><br>Most of our teachers feel challenged, defeated, and angry with Alex. They prefer dealing with Alex through methods that exclude him from the group. They ask him to calm himself down by standing outside the classroom, or they send him to time-out when he interrupts the learning of others in class.<br><br>I feel upset about his behaviors. He is smart enough to understand what he is doing. He knows what is right and wrong, but he chooses not to do what is right. He makes trouble for himself in his classes.

He wants to have power, &#x201c;to be the boss.&#x201d; Alex may be thinking, &#x201c;The teacher cannot make me follow her instructions. I feel safe and happy if I can control this situation. I am the boss and nobody can tell me what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Using the Coded Messages column (&#x201c;Let me help. Give me choices&#x201d;) and suggestions in the last column, we decided to create more responsibilities for Alex and to encourage him to help others. I had a meeting with Alex in which we discussed the issues, and I invited him to choose a few reasonable options to try over a period of at least one month. I created the following chart to keep track of the existing behavior and two options of new behaviors for Alex to choose.<br><br>During the next few weeks, Alex might slip into his old behaviors, and I would ask, &#x201c;What did you decide you would do when you are bored?&#x201d; He would remember his choice and would do it.

This tool has made the biggest difference in my understanding of a child&#x2019;s purposeful, although at times misguided, behavior. By recognizing the child&#x2019;s belief behind his behavior of choice, I have been able to redirect behavior so that positive outcomes can occur for the child, myself, and the whole class.<br><br>Instead of being irritated by a child who consistently needs undue attention, I now see the purpose behind his behavior and understand the child&#x2019;s private logic and misguided goal. Instead of reacting out of my own stress when I feel irritated, I become a goal detective and look for the coded message in the child&#x2019;s misbehavior. I realize the child&#x2019;s behavior is his way of saying &#x201c;notice me, connect with me.&#x201d; I have a game plan that immediately brings into play the tools that will help the student connect in positive, constructive ways, rather than continuing to seek this connection in negative ways. I know that giving the student a job, involving the student in a cooperative learning group, and simply taking a moment to check in with him individually are all ways to meet his goal in a positive way and facilitate change. Knowing there is always a goal behind a student&#x2019;s behavior keeps me from simply reacting emotionally and becoming a part of the child&#x2019;s misguided behavior. Instead, I can think rationally and focus on the clues that reveal the student&#x2019;s actual need as opposed to the mistaken belief that is motivating his negative behavior.<br><br>&#x2014;Meg Frederick, kindergarten teacher, Atlanta<br><br>Tool Tips<br><br>1.It takes a paradigm shift to remember to deal with the belief behind the behavior instead of just the behavior.<br><br>2.Using the Mistaken Goal Detective Clue Form and goal disclosure takes time that will be saved tenfold when it helps a student experience the kind of encouragement that invites behavior change.<br><br>What the Research Says</p><h2>Gravitation and Inertia</h2><p><p>Einstein's standard and battle-tested geometric theory of gravity--spacetime tells mass how to move and mass tells spacetime how to curve--is expounded in this book by Ignazio Ciufolini and John Wheeler. They give special attention to the theory's observational checks and to two of its consequences: the predicted existence of gravitomagnetism and the origin of inertia (local inertial frames) in Einstein's general relativity: inertia <i>here</i> arises from mass <i>there</i>.</p><br><p> The authors explain the modern understanding of the link between gravitation and inertia in Einstein's theory, from the origin of inertia in some cosmological models of the universe, to the interpretation of the initial value formulation of Einstein's standard geometrodynamics; and from the devices and the methods used to determine the local inertial frames of reference, to the experiments used to detect and measure the "dragging of inertial frames of reference." In this book, Ciufolini and Wheeler emphasize present, past, and proposed tests of gravitational interaction, metric theories, and general relativity. They describe the numerous confirmations of the foundations of geometrodynamics and some proposed experiments, including space missions, to test some of its fundamental predictions--in particular gravitomagnetic field or "dragging of inertial frames" and gravitational waves.</p></p><p><p>"This book is an ambitious walking tour through a host of topics in general relativity.

I helped not only my own immediate family but also my close and distant relatives and my friends, even those who had once betrayed me, by providing them with employment and a sense and source of well-being. In this regard I suppose it would suffice to highlight our contribution to urban development through the construction of a new district near Suadiye, as well as the services our institute provided to its workers, most of whom were in fact relatives of either myself or Halit ayarci. For as soon as the institute was established, Halit made the very important decision&#x2014;from which we never strayed&#x2014;that half the management positions and other important posts would be filled by members of our families and the other half by those who had the recommendation of a notable personage.</p><p>I am not sure if I need to mention the criticisms much aired in the papers long before it was decided to liquidate the institute or the ever more violent attacks that followed the institute&#x2019;s dissolution. Life can be so strange. Ten years ago the very same papers delighted in everything we did, showering us with praise and holding us aloft as a model to the world. Though they attended our every press conference and never missed an official cocktail party, these dear friends of mine now do nothing but hurl abuse.</p><p>First they condemned the organization for its unwieldy size and inefficiency. Overlooking the fact that we created jobs for so many in a country where unemployment is rampant, they railed against our excesses: three management offices, eleven management branches, forty-seven typists, and two hundred seventy control bureaus. Then they ridiculed the names of our various branches, overlooking the fact that a watch or clock is indeed made up of hands for minutes and hours, a spring, a pendulum, and a pin, as if the thing we all know as time were not in fact divided into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Later the papers called into question the training, expertise, and intellectual underpinnings of our licensed employees&#x2014;who had garnered over ten years&#x2019; experience with us&#x2014;before mercilessly denouncing my early book,&nbsp;The Life and Works of Ahmet the Timely, which had once delighted them.</p><p>After tearing to pieces&nbsp;The Life and Works of Ahmet the Timely, they went on to attack all our other studies. For days on end, we would open the papers to find reproductions of our book covers under preposterous headlines that implied the works were somehow subversive or only worthy of derision:&nbsp;The Effect of the North Wind upon the Regulation of Cosmic Time, penned with such painstaking attention to detail by the head of our Millisecond Branch (also husband to our family&#x2019;s youngest sister-in-law); or&nbsp;Time and Psychoanalysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Irdal Method of Time Characterology, both by my dear friend Dr. Ramiz; or Halit Ayarci&#x2019;s&nbsp;Social Monism and Time&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Second and Society.</p><p>As if that was not enough, they went on to accuse us outright of being frauds and charlatans, homing in on our accumulative fining system, with its proportional reductions and the bonus discounts that had once so amused and entertained our fellow citizens while also allowing the institute to pursue its varied social and scientific activities. But how warmly these same people had once applauded this system of fines, which I myself invented, just to pass the time, while watching my wife, Pakize, and Halit Ayarci play endless games of backgammon for petty cash during their gambling soirees.</p><p>One of our esteemed financiers publicly declared this system of fines a most remarkable innovation in the history of accounting and took every opportunity to remind me that he would never hesitate to put me in the same company as the illustrious financiers Doctor Turgot, Necker, and Schacht.</p><p>And he was right. For in matters of finance&#x2014;whereby money turns people into good taxpayers&#x2014;unhappiness has forever been the rule. And in the matter of fines in particular, people inevitably feel a certain discomfort. But our system was not at all like that. When an inspector notified a citizen of his fine, the offender would initially express surprise, but upon apprehending the firm logic behind the system, a smile would spread across his face until, at last understanding this was a serious matter, he would succumb to uproarious laughter. I cannot count the number of people&#x2014;especially in the early days&#x2014; who would extend a business card to our inspectors, saying, &#x201c;Oh please, you absolutely must come over to our house sometime. My wife really must see this. Here&#x2019;s my address,&#x201d; and offer to cover the inspector&#x2019;s taxi fare.</p><p>Our system of fines specified the collection of five kurus for every clock or watch not synchronized with any other clock in view, particularly those public clocks belonging to the municipality. However, the offender&#x2019;s fine would be doubled if his timepiece differed from that of any other in the vicinity. Thus the fine might rise proportionally when there were several timepieces nearby. Since the perfect regulation of time is impossible&#x2014;because of the personal freedom afforded by watches and clocks, something I was naturally in no position at the time to explain&#x2014;a single inspection, especially in one of the busier parts of town, made it possible to collect a not insignificant sum.</p><p>The last calculation required by this confusing system concerned the difference between watches or clocks that were either fast or slow. Everyone knows that a watch or clock is either fast or slow. For timepieces, there is no third state. It is an accepted axiom very much akin to the impossibility of exact regulation; that is, of course, assuming the watch or clock has not stopped altogether. But here matters become more personal. My own view is this: since man was created ruler of the universe, objects can be expected to reflect the tenor of his rule. For example, during my childhood, under the reign of Abd�lhamid II, our entire society was moribund. Our dissatisfaction stemmed from the sultan&#x2019;s long face, but it radiated out and infected even physical objects. Everyone my age will recall the mournful cries of the ferryboats of that era, with their piercing foghorns. But with the favorable unfolding of events thereafter, we find our days so full of delight that we now hear joy in a ferryboat&#x2019;s horn and in the clang of a trolley&#x2019;s bell.</p><p>The same can be said for watches and clocks. They inevitably fall in step with an owner&#x2019;s natural disposition, be it ponderous or ebullient, and in the same way they reflect his conjugal patterns and political persuasions. Certainly in a society like ours that has been swept along by one revolution after another in its relentless march toward progress, leaving behind diverse communities and entire generations, it is all too understandable that our political persuasions would find expression in this way. Political creeds remain secret for one reason or another. With so many sanctions hanging over us, no one is about to stand up in a public place and proclaim, &#x201c;Now, this is what I think!&#x201d; or even to say such a thing aloud, for that matter. Thus it is our watches and clocks that hold our secrets, as well as the beliefs and habits that set us apart from others.</p></p><h2>Speak Life: Restoring Healthy Communication in How You Think, Talk, and Pray</h2><p>Brady Boyd turns to Jesus&#x2019;s example to demonstrate that the health of a conversation is only as vibrant as the health of one&#x2019;s interactions with God.

Educated at Yale, he spent five years at sea, as a foremast hand and then as a midshipman in the navy. At thirty he was suddenly plunged into a literary career when his wife challenged his claim that he could write a better book that the English novel he was reading to her. The result was <b>Precaution</b> (1820), a novel of manners. His second book, <b>The Spy</b> (1821), was an immediate success, and with <b>The Pioneers</b> (1823) he began his series of Leatherstocking Tales. By 1826 when <b>The Last of the Mohicans</b> appeared, his standing as a major novelist was clearly established. From 1826 to 1833 Cooper and his family lived and traveled in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. Two of his most successful works, <b>The Prairie</b> and <b>The Red Rover</b>, were published in 1827. He returned to Otsego Hall in 1834, and after a series of relatively unsuccessful books of essays, travel sketches, and history, he returned to fiction &#x2013; and to Leatherstocking &#x2013; with <b>The Pathfinder</b> (1840) and <b>The Deerslayer</b> (1841). In his last decade he faced declining popularity brought on in part by his waspish attacks on critics and political opponents.

This <br>diary and the pen I am writing with are the best gifts I got -- <br>except maybe my cake. R. gave me the diary, the pen, and the white <br>frosted tiers. He also gave me emerald earbobs. I think maybe my <br>emeralds are just green glass; I hope maybe they be genuine peridots.<br> I was born May 25, 1845, at half-past seven in the morning <br>into slavery on a cotton farm a day"s ride from Atlanta. My father, <br>Planter, was the master of the place; my mother was the Mammy. My <br>half-sister, Other, was the belle of five counties. She was not <br>beautiful, but men seldom recognized this, caught up in the cloud of <br>commotion and scent in which she moved. R. certainly didn"t; he <br>married her. But then again, he just left her. Maybe that means <br>something to me. Maybe he"s just the unseldom one who do recognize.<br>2<br><br>If I strip the flesh off my bones, like they stripped the clothes off <br>my flesh in the slave market down near the battery in Charleston, <br>this would be my skeleton: childhood on a cotton farm; a time of <br>shawl-fetch slavery away in Charleston; a bare-breasted hour on an <br>auction block; drudge slavery as a maid in Beauty"s Atlanta brothel, <br>when Milledgeville was the capital of Georgia and Atlanta was <br>nothing; a season of candle-flame concubinage in the attic of that <br>house; a watery Grand Tour of Europe; and, finally, concubinage in my <br>own white clapboard home, with green shutters and gaslights, in the <br>center (near the train depot) of a fast-growing city that has become <br>the capital of Georgia, concubinage that persists till now.

Something had <br>changed, and I had changed it. Someone wanted to beat me. Mammy said <br>she"d beat me good, with a belt. Other lied and said she"d knocked <br>into the table. Said it "cause she knew it would pain Mammy to give <br>me a whipping.<br> And sometimes Planter said it when he heard me making up <br>little rhymes to sing to myself. Sometimes when Mammy was putting <br>Other to sleep on a day pallet for a nap, he would call for me to sit <br>at his feet on the broad porch and sing my little songs to <br>him. "Cindy, come sing, come sing! Ain"t you my Cinnamon and she my <br>coffee?" he"d ask. And I"d be slow to go, because I knew someone <br>might be missing me.<br> On the day Planter told me I was leaving the place, I asked <br>him what he had meant when he said that I was his cinnamon and she <br>was his coffee.

Schjeldahl self-consciously continues the modern tradition of art criticism crafted by poet-critics, providing a sharp perspective on individual artists, their work, art-world events, and new creative directions. He challenges established views, and his infectious passion for art continually engages the reader. In essays on Rothko, Munch, Warhol, Dubuffet, Nauman, Sherman, Salle, de Kooning, Guston, Ruscha, and Koons, Schjeldahl skillfully juggles theory and analysis in exploring cultural context and technique. His writings, free of the contortions of some critical prose and characterized by a sustained focus on works of art, map the contemporary art scene in New York (with occasional forays to Los Angeles and elsewhere), cataloguing the colorful personalities, cultural attractions, and ethical hazards of the art world.

Author James L. Christian takes a unique synoptic approach that will both engage and visually captivate you as the book focuses on the big picture and the interdisciplinary origins of philosophical thinking. This edition&#39;s fascinating presentation is interwoven with cartoons, quotations, and related findings from the social and physical sciences that ensure central philosophical concepts are accessible. An eclectic range of topics reinforces the author&#39;s presentation of philosophy as the individual&#39;s attempt to unify disparate world views. Interspersed biographies provide glimpses into the lives of great thinkers who have molded the Western philosophical tradition and largely influenced how society thinks today. With the help of Christian&#39;s PHILOSOPHY: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ART OF WONDERING, Eleventh Edition, you can refine the analytical skills you need to evaluate critically and contribute to the big picture of Western philosophy yourself.</p><p>James Christian received an STB in Historical Theology and a PhD in Philosophy of History, both from Boston University and is now Professor Emeritus at Santa Ana College. Long renowned for his engaging teaching and writing style, he is also author of I am also the author of ETI: The First Encounter, and a two-volume history of Western thought entitled The Wisdom Seekers: Great Philosophers of the Western World (Wadsworth, 2002). Of his approach, Christian says &#34;Intellectually, I am a child of my teacher Arnold Toynbee who instilled in me a passion to see all existence as a single phenomenon but without losing sight of the most minute details--this cave painting, this footnote, this flower in this crannied wall.&#34;This undergraduate textbook, originally published in 1973, also holds a good deal of appeal for adult readers. Christian believes that philosophy is critical thinking about the "Big Picture." He thus addresses the concerns that most people "wonder" about: Does life have meaning? Does God exist? How do you know right from wrong? and so on. Christian has also filled the book with interesting sidebars, illustrations, and relevant cartoons. This is philosophy made intelligible and fun. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>And the Ass Saw the Angel</h2><p>Cave&#x2019;s only novel to date takes on the southern gothic in this bizarre baroque tale. Born mute to a drunken mother and a demented father, tortured Euchrid Eucrow finds more compassion in the family mule than in his fellow men. But he alone will grasp the cruel fate of Cosey Mo, the beautiful young prostitute in the pink caravan on Hooper&#x2019;s Hill. And it is Euchrid, spiraling ever deeper into his mad angelic vision, who will ultimately redeem both the town and its people. Surprising, remarkable.&#x201d; The Atlanta Journal</p><p>Nick Cave was born in Australia in 1957. He moved to London with his band The Birthday Party in 1980. Four years later he founded The Bad Seeds, with whom he has made many albums. And the Ass Saw the Angel was published in 1990 and quickly became a cult classic. Cave has also appeared in, and written the music for, several films.Australian rock musician, lyricist and actor Cave's first novel is an innovative, if wildly idiosyncratic, tall tale satirizing religious fanaticism. Euchrid Eucrow, despised ungainly son of a trapper father and "slobstress" mother, grows up mute but divinely inspired during the 1940s and '50s in fundamentalist Ukulore, a rural swamp peopled with cartoon-like sinners, tricksters, retardates and imbibers of moonshine. Euchrid--self-styled Monarch of Doghead--heeds a winsome guardian angel, along with talking beasts (the title evokes Balaam's ass), and is obsessed with human cruelty and carnality. The foundling Beth, becoming revered as a child-saint, believes Euchrid is divine; Euchrid slips into her room, and is brutally hunted down by Beth's avengers. The plot, rife with gory atrocities, is relayed through clotted, gutsy prose which ranges from poetic to rabid, and is interspersed throughout with graphs, lists, genealogies and scraps of Scripture. Although Cave's manic effort will not lure traditionalists, it may snare the more adventurous. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Odyssey (Enriched Classics)</h2><p><b>Enduring Literature Illuminated by Practical Scholarship </b><br> The epic tale of Odysseus' extraordinary ten-year voyage home after the Trojan War. <br> This Enriched Classic Edition includes: <br> � A concise introduction that gives readers important background information <br> � A timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context <br> � An outline of key themes and plot points to help readers form their own interpretations <br> � Detailed explanatory notes <br> � Critical analysis and modern perspectives on the work <br> � Discussion questions to promote lively classroom and book group interaction <br> � A list of recommended related books and films to broaden the reader's experience <br> Enriched Classics offer readers affordable editions of great works of literature enhanced by helpful notes and insightful commentary.

In simple but powerful prose, the deeply moving The Drama of the Gifted Child showed how parents unconsciously form and deform the emotional lives of their children. Alice Miller&#39;s stories about the roots of suffering in childhood resonated with readers everywhere, and her book soon achieved cult status and became a backlist bestseller.In The Truth Will Set You Free Miller returns to the intensely personal tone and themes of her best-loved work. Only by embracing the truth of our past histories can any of us hope to be free of pain in the present, she argues. Miller&#39;s vivid true stories reveal the perils of early-childhood mistreatment and the dangers of mindless obedience to parental will. Drawing on the latest research on brain development, she shows how spanking and humiliation produce dangerous levels of denial. This denial, necessary for the child&#39;s survival, leads to emotional blindness and finally to mental barriers that cut off awareness and the ability to learn new ways of acting. If this cycle repeats itself, the grown child will perpetrate the same abuse on later generations, warns Miller-a message vitally important, especially given the increasing popularity of programs like Tough Love and of &#34;child disciplinarians&#34; like James Dobson and other religion-driven psychologists. The Truth Will Set You Free will provoke and inform all readers who want to know Alice Miller&#39;s latest thinking on this important subject.</p><p>Alice Miller has achieved worldwide recognition for her work on the causes and effects of childhood traumas. Her books include <i>The Drama of the Gifted Child</i>, <i>Banished Knowledge</i>, <i>Breaking Down the Wall of Silence</i>, <i>Thou Shalt Not Be Aware</i>, and <i>For Your Own Good</i>. She lives in Switzerland.With the premise that abuse begets abuse, the famed Swiss psychoanalyst mounts an eloquent argument against all forms of cruelty to children, especially corporal punishment. Believing that "[o]ur bodies retain a complete memory of the humiliations we suffered, driving us to inflict unconsciously on the next generation what we endured in childhood," she argues that childhood trauma is also manifest in many physical ailments, urging doctors to take "childhood reality" into account during treatment. However, frequent references to her other books, notably the bestselling The Drama of the Gifted Child and For Your Own Good give this slim book an air of preaching to the converted. Miller reiterates her distrust of "sadism sanctioned by religions" from Islam to U.S. Christian schools, and of behaviors that range from genital mutilation and circumcision to corporal punishment. She reserves particular concern for the Catholic Church's failure to outlaw beatings in European schools. Among her most intriguing finding is that children who survive brutality without repeating it generally have enjoyed the affection of a "Helping Witness" in their lives. Adults, too, can free themselves through rigorous analysis that acknowledges early trauma and confronts one's defense mechanisms and behavior patterns. Some forms of psychotherapy may be useful, Miller believes, but she discounts the value of "relaxation training or meditation." Even "power of love" alone can be overestimated, she says. (Sept.)Forecast: Given Miller's stature, this book will be visible, though the publicity may drive readers to her more seminal works.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN Examination, 5th Edition</h2><p><p>There is a reason <em>Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN�</em> <em>Examination</em> has been called "the best NCLEX exam review book ever."

This volume surveys the subject of nudity from the earliest surviving photographs of Greek and Roman sculpture through studies of living nude models for aesthetic or scientific purposes to the burgeoning practice of exploring the human body as pure form.<br> &nbsp;<br> The seventy-eight works, selected from the extensive collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum and further contextualized here in the essay &#x201c;Masterworks of the Nude,&#x201d; span the entire arc of the history of photography in a manner that is both fresh and illuminating. Among the sixty-four photographers included are nineteenth-century masters Julia Margaret Cameron, Edgar Degas, and Thomas Eakins; early-twentieth-century artists Man Ray, Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Weston; mid-twentieth-century innovators Bill Brandt, Harry Callahan, and Minor White; late-twentieth-century image makers Diane Arbus, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Herb Ritts; and contemporary artists Chuck Close, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and Mona Kuhn.</p><p>Part of a medium format series of thematic books that survey the Getty Museum's collection of photographs,&nbsp;<i>The Nude in Photography </i>features 78 plates along with a brief, but insightful essay intended to introduce the reader to the major aesthetic and technical developments that have shaped the genre. &nbsp;Paul Martineau is associate curator in the Department of Photographs at the J.

Nowhere in Dickens's later novels is his attack on an uncaring society more imaginatively embodied, but nowhere either is the mixture of comedy and angry satire more deftly managed.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Egan emphasizes the collaborative nature of the therapist-client relationship and uses a practical, three-stage model that drives client problem-managing and opportunity-developing action. Egan masterfully leads readers step-by-step through the counseling process, while giving them a feeling for the complexity inherent in any helping relationship. As readers begin to understand the various steps of the helping model, they are able to improve their competence and confidence measurably.

Soon after Sir Thomas absents himself on estate business in Antigua (the family&#39;s investment in slavery and sugar is considered in the Introduction in a new, post-colonial light), Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive at Mansfield, bringing with them London glamour, and the seductive taste for flirtation and theatre that precipitates a crisis. While Mansfield Park appears in some ways to continue where Pride and Prejudice left off, it is, as Kathryn Sutherland shows in her illuminating Introduction, a much darker work, which challenges &#39;the very values (of tradition, stability, retirement and faithfulness) it appears to endorse&#39;. This new edition provides an accurate text based, for the first time since its original publication, on the first edition of 1814.</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Man and Wife (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Man and Wife</em> (1870) combines the fast pace and sensational plot structure of Collins's most famous novels with a biting attack on the inequitable marriage laws in Victorian Britain. At its centre is the plight of a woman who fears that the archaic marriage laws of Scotland and Ireland may have forced her into committing unintentional bigamy. As the novel progresses, the atmosphere grows increasingly sinister when the setting moves from a country house to a London suburb and a world of confinement, plotting, and murder.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

He left school at 17, and after an unhappy spell as a clerk in a tea broker&#39;s office, during which he wrote his first, unpublished novel, he entered Lincoln&#39;s Inn as a law student in 1846. He considered a career as a painter, but after the publication, in 1848, of his life of his father, and a novel, Antonina, in 1850, his future as a writer was assured. His meeting with Dickens in 1851 was perhaps the turning-point of his career. The two became collaborators and lifelong friends. Collins contributed to Dickens&#39;s magazines Household Words and All the Year Round, and his two best-known novels, The Woman in White and The Moonstone, were first published in All the Year Round. Collins&#39;s private life was as complex and turbulent as his novels. He never married, but lived with a widow, Mrs. Caroline Graves, from 1858 until his death. He also had three children by a younger woman, Martha Rudd, whom he kept in a separate establishment. Collins suffered from &#39;rheumatic gout&#39;, a form of arthritis which made him an invalid in his later years, and he became addicted to the laudanum he took to ease the pain of the illness. He died in 1889.Norman Page is Emeritus Professor of English Literature at the University of Nottingham.

He founded Anchor Books and launched the quality paperback revolution, cofounded the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, and created of the Library of America, the prestigious publisher of American classics, and The Reader's Catalog, the precursor of online bookselling. In this short book he discusses the severe crisis facing the book business today&#x2015;a crisis that affects writers and readers as well as publishers&#x2015;and looks ahead to the radically transformed industry that will revolutionize the idea of the book as profoundly as the introduction of movable type did five centuries ago.</p><p>As editor-publisher to some of the 20th-century's greatest writers (Edmund Wilson, Vladimir Nabokov, Jane Jacobs) as well as the virtual inventor of the trade paperback (meaning the "quality" type, as opposed to the drugstore mass-market), Jason Epstein is one of those rare publishing-world types who is as invested in the editorial creation of a good book as in its marketing and sales. It is that dual perspective that has guided his half-century-long publishing career and that makes this compact yet expansive professional memoir such a lively, illuminating read for anyone curious how current trade publishing--basically popular general-interest fiction and nonfiction--became obsessed with a narrow pool of quickie bestsellers to the neglect of the far greater mass of slow-burners (known in the biz as "midlist") or of the perennial sellers from years past ("backlist"). But, Epstein follows up with great enthusiasm, the time is not long before the book biz will morph into a new cyberversion of the quirky, intimate "cottage industry" that it was in its precorporate era.<p> It was in that era that Epstein came of age as a publisher, first at Doubleday in the 1950s, where he founded the successful Anchor Books, the first line of high-quality paperback reissues of classics. The four succeeding decades he spent at Random House, which in that time grew from a family-type shop into one of the largest and most profitable trade publishing houses in the U.S. (currently owned by the German media titan Bertelsmann). Epstein's chronicle of New York publishing jumps around nimbly in time--at one point, all the way back to the 19th century--but it is in recounting the heady, culturally efflorescent postwar years that he waxes most tender, regaling us with vignettes of Ralph Ellison, Mary McCarthy, John O'Hara, Frank O'Hara, W.H. Auden, Chester Kallman, and John Ashbery. Throughout, his entrepreneurial spirit in the service of good books is evident--first in the founding (along with, among others, his wife Barbara) of the still-extant <i>New York Review of Books</i>, then in the thorny 30-year process of publishing the classics imprint Library of America, and in the launching of <i>The Reader's Catalog</i>, a mail-order service from which customers could choose from what nearly every book on the planet in print--and which deservedly has been called the hard-copy precursor to the very site you're browsing right now. </p><p> Like <i>The Business of Books</i>, the recent memoir from former Pantheon Books head Andre Schiffrin (Epstein's longtime colleague within Random House), Epstein's book decries the extent to which superstores like Barnes &amp; Noble have forced the high-stakes (and seldom fruitful) corporatization of book publishing. But Epstein prefers to look past the current situation to an imminent day when writers will sell directly to readers over the Internet, a format that will still demand the services of editors, publicists, and marketers but will cut out the costly middlemen of publishing companies, distributors, and superstores (though not small booksellers, he assures us, which nurture bonds among booklovers that even the Web can't sever). Yes, there's money to be made in trade books, Epstein asserts, but not necessarily overnight. And in this brisk, affable, and forward-looking volume, Epstein's own broad-ranging experience in the book biz seems to bear out his recurring theme: do it for love, not money, and the money (if not necessarily the millions) will eventually follow. --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p>Jason Epstein, former editorial director of Random House, was the first recipient of the National Book Award for Distinguished Service to American Letters.</p><h2>Loose-leaf for Business and Administrative Communication</h2><p>Business and Administrative Communication 12e is Flexible, Specific, Interesting, Comprehensive, and Up-to-Date.

In this engrossing study, Mark C. Carnes argues that fraternal rituals created a fantasy world antithetical to prevailing religious practices, gender roles, and institutional structures, offering a male religious counterculture that opposed an increasingly liberal and feminized Protestantism.&nbsp;"[An] original and compelling study. . . . Making use of anthropology as well as social history, Carnes is probably the first outsider to take these rituals seriously. . . . Playing the role of a graceful, controlling . . . guide into these mysteries, Carnes slowly unveils his thesis, which itself has several layers of mystery."&#x2015;David Leverentz, <i>New England Quarterly</i><i></i>&nbsp;"An imaginative fusion of social and intellectual history. . . . Carnes&#x2019;s work shows the true depth of nineteenth-century male sexual anxiety and hostility toward women.

Stearns, <i>Journal of Ritual Studies</i><br><br>"The breadth and thoroughness of this book is impressive. Carnes draws on the literature of the time, religious history and theology, child rearing and developmental psychology, women's history and gender studies, and structural and cultural anthropology."&#x2015;Rosamund Orde-Powlett, <i>Literary Review</i></p><p>Mark C. Carnes received his undergraduate degree from Harvard and his Ph.D. in history from Columbia University, where he studied and trained with Professor John A. Garraty. The Ann Whitney Olin Professor History at Barnard College, Columbia University, Professor Carnes has chaired both the departments of History and American Studies at Barnard. In addition to this textbook, Carnes and Garraty have co-authored &#34;Mapping America&#39;s Past: A Historical Atlas&#34; and are co-general editors of the 24-volume &#34;American National Biography,&#34; for which they were awarded the Waldo Leland Prize of the American Historical Association, the Darmouth Prize of the American Library Association, and the Hawkins Prize of the American Association of Publishers. In addition, Carnes has published numerous books in American social and cultural history, including &#34;Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies&#34; (1995), &#34;Novel History: Historians and Novelists Confront America&#39;s Past (and Each Other)&#34; (2001), and &#34;Invisible Giants: 50 Americans That Shaped the Nation but Missed the History Books&#34; (2002). Carnes also created &#34;Reacting to the Past,&#34; which won the Theodore Hesburgh Award, sponsored by TIAA-CREF, as the outstanding pedagogical innovation of 2004. &#34;Garraty preaches a particular doctrine on historical writing, expounding on the details of a complex process whereby the murky abstractions of the past are distilled into clean, clear narrative. He insists that the writer&#39;s sole duty is to readers. This literary alchemy is all the more wondrous for being so devoid of artifice,&#34; Carnes observes. John A. Garraty.

His areas of research interest include the Gilded age, unemployment (in a historical sense), and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Of his collaboration with Carnes on &#34;The American Nation,&#34; Garraty says, &#34;Although this volume is the work of two authors, it is as nearly the product of a single historical sensibility as is possible. Mark&#39;s scholarly specialization in cultural and social issues, especially gender, complements mine in politics and the economy. The book has benefited, too, from his special interest in postwar America. Over the many years of our collaborations, one of our favorite topics of discussion has been the craft of historical writing. We share a commitment to clarity and conciseness. We strive to avoid jargon and verbiage. We believe that while the political history of the nation provides a useful narrative framework, its people are what give the story meaning.&#34;Carnes (history, Barnard Coll., Columbia) has examined the appeal of "secret organizations" (Freemasons, etc.) and their initiation rituals to Victorian men and has discovered some very interesting things about the role they played in Victorian society. As he points out, the major activity of these groups was their initiation rituals. Carnes sees these fraternal orders as fostering a fantasy world that was in direct opposition to the religious, social, and institutional demands of Victorian society. This sort of male "counterculture" helped many men make the transition from boyhood to manhood.

We learn, for example, how to listen more sharply for Haydn's humor, to Mozart's singular combination of pathos with grace, and to the evolution of Beethoven's musical ideas in his epoch-making nine symphones. The range and variety of composers are remarkable--Schumann's musical poetry, Tchaikovsky's melodic genius, Mendelssohn's patrician elegance, Mahler's wild and beautiful innovations, Bruckner's mighty cathedrals in tone, the brooding mysteries of Sibelius, Stravinsky's fascinating engagements with the past, and Aaron Copland's ebullient American athleticism--and all are illuminated by Steinberg's deft, inviting, and intensely personal essays. The book boasts generous coverage of American composers, with sections on Howard Hanson, Walter Piston, Roger Sessions, Aaron Copland, William Schuman, and John Harbison. Steinberg gives us such a vivid portrait of each composer's personality that we get the most immediate sense of how the work is a direct expression of the person from whose soul and brain it has sprung.<br> Tracing the ways in which composers have dealt with the extraordinary musical challenges that have engaged them throughout the centuries, Steinberg takes us through the revolutions of expression, sound, and form that have shaped the symphony's remarkable history. Whether beginners or veterans, music lovers will listen to the symphony with enlivened interest and deeper understanding with Steinberg's masterful guide in hand.</p><p>This is a serious, inclusive look at symphonic composers and their work. A well-constructed reference, it examines the development of the symphonic art from its beginnings to the present day, composer by composer, in chronological order. This would be a useful addition to any music bookshelf.<br><strong>Michael Steinberg</strong> is the program annotator of the San Francisco Symphony and the New York Philharmonic and earlier served the Boston Symphony in the same capacity.

With warmth and candor, Bruce Feiler recounts the year he spent as a teacher in a small rural town. Beginning with a ritual outdoor bath and culminating in an all-night trek to the top of Mt. Fuji, Feiler teaches his students about American culture, while they teach him everything from how to properly address an envelope to how to date a Japanese girl.</p></p><p><p>Bruce Feiler is the author of six consecutive <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including <em>Abraham</em>, <em>Where God Was Born</em>, <em>America's Prophet</em>, <em>The Council of Dads</em>, and <em>The Secrets of Happy Families</em>. He is a columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>, a popular lecturer, and a frequent commentator on radio and television. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and twin daughters.</p>A young North American spends a year teaching in a rural Japanese school, where he watches day-to-day life with a delighted, observant eye. Feiler begins with a description of the ritual outdoor bath that all male teachers participate in at the start of the school year: ``We had not soaked long in the water before my presence began to attract a crowd...The other teachers cheered and splashed water in support. `He sure is tall,' said one man. `And his nose is high, too,' observed another. `He looks like a model.' '' The author then moves on to tell how his students spend hours learning to bow together, how teachers strictly separate their private and public lives (``Co-workers who were rude to one another in the bar would be civil the next day at work; men who had been open and relaxed in the bath would be formal and rigid when behind a desk''); how boys and girls learn gender roles at outdoor sports festivals; how young men and women struggle with changing courtship codes. He writes of Japan's emphasis on discipline and community spirit, of his students' often desperate desire to enter the Univ. of Tokyo, and of a young boy's suicide, caused largely by class prejudice. Meanwhile, in hilarious episodes, his Japanese hosts constantly marvel at his ability to use chopsticks and his ability to speak Japanese, but by the end of the school year, they pay him the highest compliment by saying that he is ``more Japanese than a Japanese.'' Feiler's first book (which, the publisher says, is the first book written by a Westerner who has taught in Japanese schools) is warm, intimate, and often very funny, bringing much-needed insight into Japanese grass-roots culture and the role of education in that land. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Throughout the five-month journey, the master of haiku kept a record of his impressions in a prose-poetry dairy called Oku no Hosomichi, "The Narrow Road to the Far North." That dairy was to become one of the classics of Japanese literature. <p>In A Reader's Guide to Japanese Literature, J. Thomas Rimer writes of this classic: </p><p>"[The wry and human touch Basho brought to his haiku] ... may well serve to disguise for the casual reader the fact that Basho was a profoundly serious artist, whose work can be read and pondered for spiritual depths, however pleasant it may be to splash around in his shallows. Nowhere can these qualities be better seen than in his long poetic diary The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Oku no hosomichi), first published in 1702, eight years after his death. It is the longest and, in received opinion, the greatest of his travel accounts, although several of the others ... contain passages in prose and poetry of the highest accomplishment. Basho wrote the diary as a literary re-creation of an actual journey he made to the then remote reaches of northern Japan, a trip begun in 1689 and lasting for over two years. In this diary, which he kept reworking and revising until his death, he mixed fact, fiction, poetry, and prose to create the record of a journey that moves both geographically and spiritually, one strand mixing with the other on virtually every page. Read and reread with care, The Narrow Road to the Deep North can reveal more qualities still basic to Japanese cultural attitudes than perhaps any other work in the whole canon of classical literature. For once, the highest of reputations is truly deserved."</p></p><p>The Translator: Dorothy Guyver Britton--writer, poet, and composer--is half English and half American, and was born in Japan.

From evolution to the epidural and beyond, Tina Cassidy presents an intelligent, enlightening, and impeccably researched cultural history of how and why we&#x2019;re born the way we are. Women have been giving birth for millennia but that&#x2019;s about the only constant in the final stage of the great process that is human reproduction. Why is it that every culture and generation seems to have its own ideas about the best way to give birth? Cassidy explores the physical, anthropological, political, and religious factors that have and will continue to influence how women bring new life into the world.</p><p>Tina Cassidy, an acclaimed author and journalist, spent most of her career as a reporter and editor at the Boston Globe, where she covered a variety of topics, including business, politics, and fashion. She is also the author of Birth: The Surprising History of How We Are Born. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband and their three sons.Blame it on the pelvis. The awkward shape and size of that bony structure makes childbirth both difficult and dangerous. As a result, humans are the only mammals who need help to deliver their children, notes Tina Cassidy in Birth. Other animals have a straight shot through the birth canal, but our babies have to twist and turn to get out of that darn pelvis -- or, as I came to imagine it during my own pregnancy, to squeeze themselves like a basketball through a Pringles can.<p>But infrastructure is only the first problem. Human interference can make things much worse. In this breezy popular history, Cassidy, a former Boston Globe reporter and editor, surveys centuries of terrible childbirths around the world, attended by doctors, nurses and midwives with strange theories and, in more than a few cases, deeply sadistic streaks. Tirelessly wide-eyed, Cassidy details how laboring women have been strapped down and shackled, drugged into oblivion and ripped open with a macabre array of tools more suited to taxidermy than obstetrics. It's amazing anyone got out of the womb alive.</p><p> Childbirth fads and customs in Western cultures swing from one extreme to another and back again, Cassidy writes. First there were midwives, who were then replaced by doctors, recently unseated by a returning vogue for midwives. For centuries, babies were born at home, then women opted for hospitals; now, those hospitals are trying to make their delivery wards more "homey." Mothers breastfed for thousands of years, then they were told that formula was better. Now it's back to nursing. Painkillers are in, then they're out. And so it goes, literally ad nauseam.</p><p> It's not surprising that childbirth would be the focus of such ambivalence and anxiety. Throughout history, the making of children has been at once a low-odds proposition and a high-stakes affair -- not the joyful experience it is advertised as today but a matter of dowries, alliances and staffing up the farm. Maternal and neonatal death rates ran high at all levels of society. In male-dominated cultures, the fact that women were solely responsible for gestation and delivery must have been an affront. No wonder, then, that the attending women were eventually supplanted by male doctors.</p><p> Those doctors -- as early as the 16th century in Europe -- had startlingly little training and a severe distrust of the more experienced midwives. They were taught on makeshift mannequins and many hadn't even seen a live birth before they began to perform deliveries -- sometimes with their hands covered by a sheet, too embarrassed (or concerned for their patients' modesty) to look directly at the body parts they were working on.</p><p> Then came the hospitals. Cassidy points out that, for most of human history, the majority of women have given birth in or around their homes. Those who first delivered at American hospitals, starting in the 18th century, may have been at far greater risk of injury and death than their mothers. Doctors regularly moved from autopsies to live patients without ensuring sterile conditions -- or even washing their hands. They didn't know they had to. Some blamed the women themselves for the resulting infections, citing tight petticoats, loose morals and anxious "fretting" as causes. Even after germ theory became generally known, infant deaths from birth injuries in the United States jumped a shocking 50 percent between 1915 and 1929, Cassidy writes, because more women were giving birth in overcrowded, vermin-infested hospitals, where hand-washing still wasn't standard procedure and staff engaged in "aggressive" obstetrics that amounted to brutally wrenching the child out of its mother.</p><p> In contrast, women today seek out the best "birth experience," whether it's the "give me the epidural in the hospital parking lot" approach or multi-week Lamaze classes. But these so-called choices mask a less certain reality. Childbirth is unpredictable, and the best-laid birth plans are no guarantee. We are still ambivalent about this business, decrying the medicalization of childbirth but embracing its ability to get that newborn out safely if we hit a rough patch.</p><p> Cassidy has put together a concise survey, with more breadth than depth. Some of the material won't be all that surprising to anyone who has prepared for childbirth or at least paged through What To Expect When You're Expecting. But there's plenty of new gore for those who want it.</p><p> Oh, and there's more about that pelvis: It makes things hard in the months after birth, too. Over millennia, as human forebears got smarter and their brains grew larger, evolution found a balance: Since the pelvic opening can't grow any wider and still allow us to walk on two legs, babies' heads can't grow any bigger. This is why, Cassidy writes, our infants are born "altricial": With their brains still developing, they are helpless and in need of extended parental care. A shivering newborn calf can stumble to its feet within an hour after birth, but a human doesn't walk for about a year. Anatomy is destiny, in this case: Even after they make it through childbirth, parents are in for a long -- and bumpy -- ride. </p><p>Reviewed by Sara Sklaroff <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

But their growing use is not without environmental, economic, and geopolitical consequences.<br><br> Abraham traces these elements' secreted paths from mines to our living rooms, from the remote hills of China to the frozen Gulf of Finland, providing vivid accounts of those who produce, trade, and rely on rare metals. He argues that these materials are increasingly playing a significant role in global affairs, conferring strength to countries and companies that can ensure sustainable supplies.<br><br> Just as oil, iron, and bronze revolutionized previous eras, so too will these metals.

Mr. Fukuoka is perhaps most known for his bestselling book <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> (1978), a manifesto on the importance of no-till agriculture, which was at the time of publication a radical challenge to the global systems that supply the world&#x2019;s food, and still inspires readers today. Larry Korn, who apprenticed with Mr. Fukuoka in Japan at the time, translated the manuscript and brought it to the United States, knowing it would change the conversation about food forever. <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>, edited by Korn and Wendell Berry, was an immediate international success, and established Mr. Fukuoka as a leading voice in the fight against conventional industrial agriculture. In this new book, through his own personal narrative, Larry Korn distills his experience of more than thirty-five years of study with Mr. Fukuoka, living and working on his farm on Shikoku Island, and traveling with Mr. Fukuoka to the United States on two six-week visits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <em>One-Straw Revolutionary</em> is the first book to look deeply at natural farming and intimately discuss the philosophy and work of Mr. Fukuoka. In addition to giving his personal thoughts about natural farming, Korn broadens the discussion by pointing out natural farming&#x2019;s kinship with the ways of indigenous cultures and traditional Japanese farming. At the same time, he clearly distinguishes natural farming from other forms of agriculture, including scientific and organic agriculture and permaculture. Korn also clarifies commonly held misconceptions about natural farming in ways Western readers can readily understand. And he explains how natural farming can be used practically in areas other than agriculture, including personal growth and development.<br> <br> The book follows the author on his travels from one back-to-the-land commune to another in the countryside of 1970s Japan, a journey that eventually led him to Mr. Fukuoka&#x2019;s natural farm. Korn&#x2019;s description of his time there, as well as traveling with Mr. Fukuoka during his visits to the United States, offers a rare, inside look at Mr. Fukuoka&#x2019;s life. Readers will delight in this personal insight into one of the world&#x2019;s leading agricultural thinkers.</p></p><p><p>Larry Korn was an American who lived and worked on the farm of Masanobu Fukuoka for more than two years in the early 1970s. He was translator and editor of the English-language edition of Mr. Fukuoka&#x2019;s <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> and editor of his later book, <em>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</em>. Korn accompanied Mr. Fukuoka on his visits to the United States in 1979 and 1986.&nbsp;He studied Asian history, soil science, and plant nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley, and worked in wholesale and retail plant nurseries, as a soil scientist for the California Department of Forestry, and as a residential landscape contractor in the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout his life, Korn taught many courses and workshops about natural farming, permaculture, and local food production throughout the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>CHOICE-</strong></em></p> <p>"This book brings fascinating insight and perspective to the contributions of Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008), the founder&nbsp;of the worldwide natural farming movement. Written by a former student and farm intern of Fukuoka, it recounts his life and work, and documents the author's own travels in Japan and early experiences working on Fukuoka's farm in the&nbsp;1970s. It goes on to discuss natural farming techniques using Fukuoka's farm as a case study, and describes the writing&nbsp;and publication of <em>The One Straw Revolution</em> (1975) and the resultant rise in international interest in natural farming.&nbsp;As it compares natural farming with indigenous farming, traditional Japanese agriculture,&nbsp;permaculture, and modern-day organic farming, the direction of the book changes from memory and reflection to an&nbsp;oversimplified discussion of agricultural theory. As a memoir it is compelling.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Larry Korn shines a light on the path that Fukuoka discovered integrating indigenous agriculture with a deep reverence for the land and natural processes.&nbsp;Many revolutions of the sun later, it is clear that the continued illumination of this path is necessary to bring about a stewardship culture of soil, plant, animal, and human. We are fortunate to have a torch bearer in Korn who embodies the words of Taoist sage, Lao T&#x2019;zu, &#x2018;what you do is what you are.&#x2019;&#x201d;<strong>--Don Tipping, founder of Seven Seeds Farm and Siskiyou Seeds</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This mind-opening book will provide the proper contextual knowledge and understanding on how nature works for any practitioner involved in&nbsp;farming, ranching, ecosystem restoration, or natural-resource management.&#x201d;<strong>--Ray Archuleta, conservation agronomist, Natural Resources Conservation Service</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Larry Korn virtually brings Masanobu Fukuoka back to life in&nbsp;<em>One-Straw Revolutionary&nbsp;</em>by highlighting his experience of more than thirty-five years of study with Mr. Fukuoka. Here we not only get a new look at Mr. Fukuoka&#x2019;s natural farming but also his life in general. For those who have or have not read the insightful&nbsp;<em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>, I highly recommend this delightful book about one of the world&#x2019;s great agricultural thinkers.&#x201d;<strong>--John P. Reganold, Regents Professor of Soil Science &amp; Agroecology at Washington State University</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>One-Straw Revolutionary</em>&nbsp;is a profound sharing of the essential philosophy of natural farming translated through the friendship between Larry Korn and Masanobu Fukuoka. Larry&#x2019;s engaging story offers wise insights into authentic practices that honor the community of all life. I deeply resonate with both the author&#x2019;s perspectives and Fukuoka&#x2019;s clear understanding of a revolutionary pathway for creating abundance by honoring the natural patterns of our earth.&#x201d;<strong>--Katrina Blair, author of&nbsp;<em>The Wild Wisdom of Weeds</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In <em>One-Straw Revolutionary</em>, Larry Korn revisits his experiences with Masanobu Fukuoka, one of the most important thinkers in agricultural history. This book is a sort of sequel to Mr. Fukuoka&#x2019;s <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>One-Straw Revolution</em>, clarifying and amplifying that book and then going on to reveal Mr. Korn&#x2019;s own intriguing contributions to the new social and agricultural order.&#x201d;<strong>--Gene Logsdon, author of <em>Gene Everlasting</em> and <em>A Sanctuary of Trees &nbsp; </em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I still think&nbsp;<em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>&nbsp;is the best book Rodale ever published, and we can thank Larry Korn for bringing it to us. Larry&#x2019;s deep insight into Fukuoka-san&#x2019;s Zen-like approach to farming threw a new light on the organic method of farming and gardening for me, as I was then an editor of&nbsp;<em>Organic Gardening</em>&nbsp;magazine. Through Larry, I was able to see that the question is not, &#x2018;What can I do next?&#x2019; but rather, &#x2018;What can I stop doing without diminishing the results?&#x2019; This impulse toward simplicity is the master&#x2019;s great gift to the world, carried forth into&nbsp;the world by Larry Korn.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Jeff Cox, author&nbsp;of twenty books,&nbsp;including the best-selling&nbsp;<em>From Vines to Wines</em>&nbsp;and the James Beard Foundation-nominated&nbsp;<em>The Organic Cook&#x2019;s Bible</em>, and former managing editor of&nbsp;<em>Organic Gardening</em>&nbsp;magazine</strong></p></p><h2>On Being Authentic (Thinking in Action)</h2><p>'To thine own self be true.' From Polonius's words in <em>Hamlet</em> right up to Oprah, we are constantly urged to look within. Why is being authentic the ultimate aim in life for so many people, and why does it mean looking inside rather than out? Is it about finding the 'real' me, or something greater than me, even God? And should we welcome what we find?<br><br>Thought-provoking and with an astonishing range of references, <em>On Being Authentic</em> is a gripping journey into the self that begins with Socrates and Augustine. Charles Guignon asks why being authentic ceased to mean being part of some bigger, cosmic picture and with Rousseau, Wordsworth and the Romantic movement, took the strong inward turn alive in today's self-help culture. <br><br>He also plumbs the darker depths of authenticity, with the help of Freud, Joseph Conrad and Alice Miller and reflects on the future of being authentic in a postmodern, global age. He argues ultimately that if we are to rescue the ideal of being authentic, we have to see ourselves as fundamentally social creatures, embedded in relationships and communities, and that being authentic is not about what is owed to me but how I depend on others.</p><p>Charles Guignon teaches philosophy at the University of South Florida. He is the author of <em>Heidegger and the Problem of Knowledge</em> and editor of <em>The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger</em>.<p><strong>"... traverses often very dense acreages of philosophical argument with considerable elegance. It never patronises the reader, or gives the impression of talking down to them. It is enthusiastic and engaging ...

Alsop, neither of which I had ever expected to see again.<br><br> &#x201c;Please calm down, Miss. I know you want to be with your young man, but Mr. Fletcher&#x2019;s feet are a mere four feet above your head, tending to the business of getting you and your ship as far away from the coast of France as quickly as possible. Please let him do that and allow me to take care of you.&#x201d;<br><br> You might have thought that Jaimy and I would have tumbled into the sack right then and there, as soon as we got back on the Nancy B., but no, such was not to be.While Jaimy assumed the con on the quarterdeck and gave orders to set sail and fly, Higgins hauled my sobbing and gasping self into my cabin, where he stripped me down to clean me up and, hopefully, make me presentable. That&#x2019;s when he discovered that I was covered head to toe with scratches and bruises from when my dear Mathilde had dragged me across that battlefield in Germany, my foot being caught in my stirrup and she being blind with terror. I don&#x2019;t blame her none&#x2014;she was a good horse and already I miss her.<br><br> &#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; exclaims Higgins. &#x201c;Amongst a veritable constellation of contusions, right there is a bruise the size of a cricket ball. A lovely shade of purple and yellow, as well, I might add.&#x201d;<br><br> My mind is still reeling from the events of the past hour. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve never been dragged on your back across some very rough ground by a terrified horse, Higgins, then you have no room to chastise me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I believe I will take a pass on that particular experience, Miss. Hold still now.&#x201d;<br><br> I feel the healing salve being applied to my poor bare and much abused bum.<br><br> Ahhhhh . . . nobody has a touch like Higgins. &#x201c;Turn over, please, Miss.&#x201d;<br> I give out a low moan and turn over on my back.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah.Your front is not quite so bad. Just a bit of salve on your shoulder and some about your knees, there. Good.&#x201d;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t mind being tended to by my dear Higgins. In fact, I&#x2019;m loving it&#x2014;that and the fact that I am still alive. I had spent the time in the lifeboat that brought me here curled up in Jaimy&#x2019;s lap, trembling and weeping&#x2014;after all, a mere hour ago I had been on my knees on the beach, waiting for a bullet from the pistol of spymaster Jardineaux to scatter my brains all over the sand&#x2014;and I do need some time to calm down.<br><br> &#x201c;But how came you to be here?&#x201d; I ask, still in wonder at my rescue. &#x201c;With our ship and Jaimy and all . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Higgins takes my shako and places it on my writing table. &#x201c;Yet another trophy,&#x201d; he muses, putting his pinkie through the bullet hole in the front. &#x201c;I shall tell you, Miss, but first will you tell me about this?&#x201d; He holds up the medal I had worn about my neck.<br><br> &#x201c;It is the Legion of Honor. I didn&#x2019;t deserve it, but L&#x2019;empereur gave it to me, anyway,&#x201d; says I, once again stretching out and reveling in the smooth sheets on my bed, my own dear bed, which tonight will hold bothme and James Emerson Fletcher&#x2014;right next to my own sweet self. Oh yes! &#x201c;The Emperor?&#x201d; asks Higgins, for once surprised and incredulous. &#x201c;Napoleon Bonaparte himself ?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right. He had given me a ride in his coach after the Battle of Jena. He wanted me to deliver a letter to Empress Josephine.Which I did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You never fail to astound me,Miss.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It was not all that astonishing,Higgins,&#x201d; I say, and then proceed to tell him of Jardineaux, the guillotine, Madame Pelletier, Les Petites Gamines, Jean-Paul,Marshal De Groot, my commission as a second lieutenant in the Grand Army, Bardot, the Clodhoppers, my job as messenger between the generals and Napoleon, my delivery of Napoleon&#x2019;s message to Murat, which ordered him to charge the Prussian line, meeting Randall Trevelyne again, the great and terrible battle, and finally, that dark time down on my knees on that beach, crying, and expecting nothing but death.<br><br> &#x201c;Remarkable,&#x201d; says Higgins, looking off into the middle distance. &#x201c;However, we might have a problem here.With that message you delivered. If Naval Intelligence gets wind of that, it might be trouble. And they certainly will not be pleased to hear of the death of Jardineaux, whom they considered very valuable.&#x201d; He shakes his head and sighs. &#x201c;I could have told them that when you,Miss, get thrown into any mix, unforeseen events occur, but I was not given that opportunity. Not till later, and then it was too late.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You asked how I knew you would be on that beach. Well, after I learned, through certain sources, that you had been pressed into the Intelligence Service, I, myself, using my Hollingsworth connections, joined that same service so as to be able to find you. I met and gained the confidence of Mr. Peel, Sir Grenville, and the very delightful Dr. Sebastian. We passed many pleasant hours at dinners and in intellectual discussions. Dr. Sebastian declared himself to be especially fond of you&#x2014;he greatly appreciated the fine illustrations you did for his naturalist endeavors and hopes he will be working with you again someday.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So I have confessed to treason in front of an agent of the Intelligence Branch?&#x201d; I ask, with some dread. Higgins is my dearest friend, but male honor and all . . .<br><br> &#x201c;Never fear, Miss,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I would never betray you, but there are other agents in France, some of whom might have learned of your actions and reported them to my colleagues in the Admiralty. We shall see. Now let us get you back into some clothing. Since we left England in a hurry, I did not have time to purchase any female garments for you. I do, however, have your midshipman uniform, the one you were wearing when you were captured.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have a dress, there in my knapsack. It will serve as my wedding dress.&#x201d;<br><br> Higgins reaches into my bag and pulls out my white gown, the one dress I had taken with me on my way to join Napoleon and the Grand Army of France.<br> &#x201c;Hmmm . . . It could use a bit of ironing, but I know you will not wait for me to do that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are so right, Higgins.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And your underclothing is not even close to dry.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The dress itself will be enough. I don&#x2019;t plan to have it on long,&#x201d; I say, popping up and putting my arms in the air so that Higgins can slip the dress over them and then over me. He adjusts it, and then I regard myself in my mirror. Not too bad, considering . . . &#x201c;May I ask, Miss, if the color of the dress is still appropriate for the wedding you seem to be planning?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, it is, Higgins. I&#x2019;ve done just about everything else, but not yet that particular thing,&#x201d; I say, getting up from my bed and not taking offense at Higgins&#x2019;s question as to the state of my rather shaky virtue. Higgins has always been my friend and protector, and has often given me gentle advice concerning my often impetuous conduct with the assorted males whom I have met on my travels, but he has never interfered when I finally set a course in that regard.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. Well. I ask only out of concern for your welfare and what you might recently have gone through.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know that,Higgins,&#x201d; I reply, continuing to look atmy reflection. &#x201c;Should I wear my wig?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ohhhh.&#x201d; Higgins shudders. &#x201c;That awful thing? No. Please. I think you will look fine without it, Miss. Let me give your hair a bit of a brush-up.&#x201d;<br><br> I sit at my desk while Higgins applies the brush.<br><br> &#x201c;How did Jaimy come to be here, standing on the deck above us?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Upon the arrival of the Nancy B. in London, I immediately sought out the Fletcher residence and found to my great joy that your Mr. Fletcher was there in the bosom of his family, recuperating from his wound. Upon his complete recovery, I, as the only senior representative of Faber ShippingWorldwide present, appointed him Captain of the Nancy B. Alsop in your absence, as I thought that would be your wish, had you been in my place.&#x201d;<br><br> I nod.<br><br> &#x201c;So. I shall finally be married this day.&#x201d; I sigh, beginning to fully come back to myself. &#x201c;I still cannot believe I was so wondrously delivered again into this world.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know you have experienced a shock, Miss, but please relax, and soon you shall be your old self. And as for marriage, may we discuss that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right, Higgins, let&#x2019;s have it.&#x201d; I know what that means&#x2014;I&#x2019;m about to be given a lecture on the proper deportment of a young lady.<br><br> &#x201c;Have you considered getting legally married first, before you leap headlong into the conjugal bed? Many people do, you know. We are only a day or so away from London and you could be legitimately married, in a church.&#x201d;<br><br> In a church? Hmmm . . . Little Mary Faber, former street urchin, married in grand style at Saint Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, wouldn&#x2019;t that be something? &#x201c;Nay, Higgins, I&#x2019;m going to be married, all right, but it&#x2019;s going to be today. A captain of a ship is authorized to perform marriages,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And, Higgins, if you think for one moment that I am not sleeping next to Jaimy Fletcher in this bed tonight, then you are sadly mistaken.&#x201d; I look up at the ceiling, amazed to think that Jaimy is right up there on the deck, not five feet above me. Imagine that . . .<br><br> &#x201c;I certainly know that a captain of a ship is authorized to perform marriages, but can he marry himself, or in this case, herself ?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, then, Higgins,&#x201d; I retort, &#x201c;as Chairwench of the Board of Faber Shipping Worldwide, I will appoint you, John Higgins, captain of the Nancy B. Alsop, current flagship of that company, for as long a time as necessary, and you are going to perform the service. See if you can find a Bible on this bark.&#x201d; And, oh, that brush feels so good! &#x201c;Yes, Miss,&#x201d; saysHiggins.&#x201c;It would probably be legal, but you must know that the very instant I pronounce you man and wife, you will never again issue an order as the head of Faber Shipping Worldwide, as your husband, Mr. Fletcher, would own all of your property, including this ship, all your shares in Faber Shipping, and even the clothing on your back. You would own nothing, not even your own self.&#x201d;<br> What? &#x201c;It is the law,Miss.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, even if it is, Jaimy would never be like that&#x2014;to deny me my rights and all,&#x201d; I say, fuming about the unfairness of it all. &#x201c;I know he wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I agree that he probably would not. But I have noticed that he has a very protective nature when it comes to you, and it is possible that in order to protect his frail and delicate flower from harm, he might order her to that rose-covered cottage by the shore to safely keep house and await his return from the perilous sea. Hmmm?&#x201d;<br><br> Damn! Higgins, why do you have to bring this up now, on the eve of my greatest happiness! &#x201c;I will speak to Mr. Fletcher about that, and we will come to an agreement, I am sure,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Anything else you might want to burden me with, Higgins, my dearest friend, confidant, consultant, protector, and ever-present conscience?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Very colorfully put, Miss, as always,&#x201d; he answers, laying down his brush, apparently satisfied with the condition of my mop. &#x201c;But, yes, there is something and it is this. If you marry, you must expect to be with child within a year. Though it would be a joyous occasion, welcoming another such as you into the world, are you ready for that particular and dangerous trial? You are, after all, still quite young.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am sixteen years old.&#x201d; I sniff. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s old enough for a lot of things.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Indeed. I have noticed that, small as you are, you do have all the necessary female equipment, and judging from what I have observed of your amorous adventures in the past, it all seems to be in excellent working order.&#x201d; &#x201c;Higgins,&#x201d; says I, with an edge of warning in my voice. &#x201c;I am but suggesting that you might think about the change in your life that would occur by your having a child.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t care, Higgins. Jaimy and I have waited long enough,&#x201d; I firmly reply. Then I blush and say, &#x201c;Plus, I know of some things . . . other things . . . other games that people who love each other play, which do not lead to babies.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You blush most becomingly, Miss. It is reassuring that your face is still able to don a maidenly flush of pink in the cheeks,&#x201d; replies Higgins, without changing his usual calm expression. &#x201c;But you do realize a marriage must be . . . consummated . . . to be legal?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, we will do it, then. Babies are born at sea, as well as on land. In fact, I helped deliver one on the Pequod. Little Elizabeth Ahab, it was, and a perfect little creature was she.&#x201d;<br><br> But it turns out that Father Neptune, that unpredictable rascal, is the one who decides my future, and not me.<br><br> &#x201c;Jacky?&#x201d; I hear from the speaking tube right above my head.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Jaimy, I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; I reply. I still can&#x2019;t believe I am alive and he is here with me and I am hearing his voice.<br><br> &#x201c;Better get ready. Looks like we&#x2019;re in for a storm.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right up.&#x201d;<br><br> I had noticed that the sea had been working up, because the Nancy B. was beginning to pitch and yaw a little more than normal. I get up and dart out of my cabin and onto the deck. There is a cheer from my own dear crew as I emerge into the light&#x2014;there&#x2019;s little Daniel Prescott,my young ship&#x2019;s boy, So good to see you again, Missy!, and my two stout sailors Smasher McGee and John Thomas, and there&#x2019;s Jim Tanner, and&#x2014;Good Lord! Up at helm is John Tinker, himself, grinning for all he is worth as he spins the wheel . . . And there&#x2019;s Jaimy, lovely Jaimy, looking oh-so-splendid standing there and gazing up at the set of the sails, his dark hair blowing about his face. Hard to believe, but three members of the original Brotherhood of the Dolphin are standing on the same rolling deck!<br><br> &#x201c;First, Jaimy, a kiss,&#x201d; I say, wrapping my arms around him and pressing my mouth on his. Ummmm . . .<br><br> I think he&#x2019;s a bit startled, this not being regular Royal Navy quarterdeck routine, but he quickly gets into the spirit of the thing. His own arms go about me and he hugs me tightly.<br><br> When our lips come apart, I lower my eyes and say to him, &#x201c;I know you for a proper young gentleman, Jaimy, but this is my ship, love, and when I am on it, I do what I want to do, and what I want to do right now is to have you kiss me again and hold me, Jaimy, hold me ever so close to you. Oh, Jaimy, we have been so long kept apart.&#x201d; And the tears are coming again, and again our lips come together and stay there for a good&#x2014;oh so very good&#x2014;long time.<br><br> Then the dear boy takes my shoulders in his hands and looks me in my streaming eyes and says, &#x201c;I want to hold you like this, Jacky, for the rest of my life, but right now I&#x2019;ve got to deal with this. You should go below, for it will be rough.&#x201d;<br><br> What . . . ? Go below? He glances over my head and I follow that look and notice that the storm has drawn closer. It looks like a bad one, a bank of storm clouds that stretches across the horizon with nothing but blackness beneath, blackness that is split every few moments by streaks of lightning, followed by the rolling thunder that rumbles across the sea, warning us to beware the fury that is surely to come.

In <em>The Jargon of Authenticity</em> he gives full expression to his hostility to the language employed by certain existentialist thinkers such as Martin Heidegger. With his customary alertness to the uses and abuses of language, he calls into question the jargon, or 'aura', as his colleague Walter Benjamin described it, which clouded existentialists' thought. He argued that its use undermined the very message for meaning and liberation that it sought to make authentic. Moreover, such language - claiming to address the issue of freedom - signally failed to reveal the lack of freedom inherent in the capitalist context in which it was written. Instead, along with the jargon of the advertising jingle, it attributed value to the satisfaction of immediate desire. Alerting his readers to the connection between ideology and language, Adorno's frank and open challenge to directness, and the avoidance of language that 'gives itself over either to the market, to balderdash, or to the predominating vulgarity', is as timely today as it ever has been.</p><p><strong>Theodor Adorno</strong> (1903 - 1969). German philosopher who was a leading member of the Frankfurt School. Adorno led an influential attack on the "culture industry" prevalent in contemporary capitalist society.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</h2><p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs. Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin&#39;s death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written. Franklin&#39;s account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different periods at which he wrote them. There are actual breaks in the narrative between the first three parts, but Part Three&#39;s narrative continues into Part Four without an authorial break.</p><p>Also available by Edmund S. Morgan: Benjamin FranklinBlessed with enormous talents and the energy and ambition to go with them, Franklin was a statesman, author, inventor, printer, and scientist. He helped draft the Declaration of Independence and later was involved in negotiating the peace treaty with Britain that ended the Revolutionary War. He also invented bifocals, a stove that is still manufactured, a water-harmonica, and the lightning rod.<br>Franklin's extraordinary range of interests and accomplishments are brilliantly recorded in his <i>Autobiography, </i> considered one of the classics of the genre. Covering his life up to his prewar stay in London as representative of the Pennsylvania Assembly, this charming self-portrait recalls Franklin's boyhood, his determination to achieve high moral standards, his work as a printer, experiments with electricity, political career, experiences during the French and Indian War, and more. Related in an honest, open, unaffected style, this highly readable account offers a wonderfully intimate glimpse of the Founding Father sometimes called "the wisest American."</p><h2>Retirement Income Redesigned: Master Plans for Distribution -- An Adviser&#39;s Guide for Funding Boomers&#39; Best Years</h2><p>Clients nearing retirement have some significant challenges to face.

The region's countries hold elections, choose leaders, and form new governments. But is the civilian government firmly in power? Or is the military still influencing policy and holding the elected politicians in check under the guise of guarding against corruption, instability, economic uncertainty, and other excesses of democracy? The editors of this work, Brian Loveman and Thomas M. Davies, Jr., argue that with or without direct military rule, antipolitics persists as a foundation of Latin American politics. This study examines the origins of antipolitics, traces its nineteenth- and twentieth-century history, and focuses on the years from 1965 to 1995 to emphasize the somewhat illusory transitions to democracy. This third edition of <i>The Politics of Antipolitics </i>has been revised and updated to focus on the post-Cold War era. With the demise of the Soviet state and international Marxism, the Latin American military has appropriated new threats including narcoterrorism, environmental exploitation, technology transfer, and even AIDS to redefine and relegitimate its role in social, economic, and political policy. The editors also address why and how the military rulers acceded to the return of civilian-elected governments and the military's defense against accusations of human rights abuses.</p><p>A valuable research tool, useful to both graduate and upper-division undergraduate levels.

Using landmark cases as well as little known state decisions, the book analyzes the law of wiretapping, drug possession, search and seizure, confessions, and sentencing. It also considers questions beyond basic law, such as whether the police understand or follow the Supreme Court's search and seizure and confession rules. The book examines broader questions, such as crime statistics manipulation, drug legalization, prisoner reentry, police brutality, the use of informants, mass imprisonment of African Americans, the distribution of limited criminal justice resources, and the media's influence on policing and public policy. Although predominantly a casebook, the text also excerpts reports by nonprofits and government agencies, law review articles, and social science literature to provide a fuller context for how court decisions impact the real world in which criminal justice policy is made and executed.</p><p>Adam Gershowitz is a professor of law at William &amp; Mary Law School.</p><h2>American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman</h2><p>Studies the views of 5 prominent mid-19th century writers on the function and nature of literature and how they applied these views to their works.</p><p>This text has taken its place as the definitive treatment of the most distinguished age of American literature.

Foremost among these explorers was navigator and cartographer Captain James Cook of the British Royal Navy.</p><p>Recent writers have viewed Cook largely through the lens of colonial exploitation, regarding him as a villain and overlooking an important aspect of his identity: his nautical skills. In this authentic, engrossing biography, Frank McLynn reveals Cook's place in history as a brave and brilliant seaman. He shows how the Captain's life was one of struggle--with himself, with institutions, with the environment, with the desire to be remembered--and also one of great success.</p><p>In <i>Captain Cook</i>, McLynn re-creates the voyages that took the famous navigator from his native England to the outer reaches of the Pacific Ocean. Ultimately, Cook, who began his career as a deckhand, transcended his humble beginnings and triumphed through good fortune, courage, and talent. Although Cook died in a senseless, avoidable conflict with the people of Hawaii, McLynn illustrates that to the men with whom he served, Cook was master of the seas and nothing less than a titan.</p></p><p><p><b>Frank McLynn</b> is a highly regarded historian specializing in biographies and military history.

Recognized expert Edgar H. Schein explains what culture is and why it's important, how to evaluate your organization's culture, and how to improve it, using straightforward, practical tools based on decades of research and real-world case studies. This new edition reflects the massive changes in the business world over the past ten years, exploring the influence of globalization, new technology, and mergers on culture and organization change. New case examples help illustrate the principals at work and bring focus to emerging issues in international, nonprofit, and government organizations as well as business. Organized around the questions that change agents most often ask, this new edition of the classic book will help anyone from line managers to CEOs assess their culture and make it more effective.</p> <ul> <li>Offers a new edition of a classic work with a focus on practitioners</li> <li>Includes new case examples and information on globalization, the effects of technology, and managerial competencies</li> <li>Covers the basics on changing culture and includes a wealth of practical advice</li> </ul></p><p>Culture. We blithely use the term for just about anything--a vibrant culture, a dominant culture, a corporate culture. But do we really know what we're saying, what <i>culture</i> really means? Or do we most often assume that the term is just a convenient way to group those with a common purpose or goal and a method for achieving it? Isn't a corporate culture, for example, just "the way we do things around here"?<p> No, it's not. In <i>The Corporate Culture Survival Guide</i>, Edgar Schein reveals how that's merely the tip of the iceberg, an iceberg that managers ignore at the peril of their company's future. Underneath lies the much-harder-to-grasp "essence" of the company, the "learned, shared, tacit assumptions on which people base their daily behavior." These assumptions are learned over time and in different internal and external environments, becoming, as Schein puts it, the "residue of success." As these assumptions influence all aspects of how a company functions, discovering their nature and cause is vital to the success of any new organization-wide venture or strategy. In the second half of the book, Schein illustrates how, using this knowledge, a company's culture can be deliberately created or changed. Supported by numerous case-study examples, his advice is pertinent to startups, mature companies, and blended organizations.</p><p> If you're the type of manager that needs a quick-fix solution, with simple catch phrases and an easy Five Step Program to Success, this book is not for you. Nor are the benefits to be gained from acquiring the depth of knowledge and insight needed to understand, work with, and transform your corporate culture. Using intelligent, lucid prose, Schein provides this kind of insight and more; he tells cautionary as well as inspiring tales of what this insight can mean for your company, and offers useful suggestions for putting knowledge into practice. <i>--S.&nbsp;Ketchum</i></p><p><b>AS THE WORLD IS BECOMING MORE COMPLEX AND GLOBAL,</b> the issues of corporate culture and subculture are more relevant to leadership and organizational performance. Leadership not only creates culture but is the central force in managing culture evolution and change. This new and revised edition of Schein's groundbreaking book shows how the management of cultural issues now involves the alignment of national, corporate, and occupational cultures. Effective organizations not only need to decide how strongly they want their corporate culture to be based on the rate of technological change, but should also be concerned about the management of the multiple subcultures that arise with increasing technological complexity. More than ever, leaders must have a clear understanding of how to manage in a multicultural environment. </p><p>Written for practitioners, Schein reinforces the emphasis on understanding the nature of culture before one leaps into culture change programs, especially in an age where mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and foreign subsidiaries make culture management more difficult. This well-timed revision of <i>The Corporate Culture Survival Guide</i> is the ideal resource for leaders looking to figure out how their corporate culture can aid or hinder current performance and future effectiveness. Reflecting the myriad changes in the field, this new and revised edition contains new examples that target the international, nonprofit and public administration sectors; highlights the effects of globalization, mergers, and technology on organizations; and features a new chapter on the competencies managers need to foster in order to cultivate an effective corporate culture. </p><p><i>The Corporate Culture Survival Guide</i> retains Schein's hands-on methods of observation, interview, and intervention to uncover the nuances as well as the details and dynamics of an organization. The book also contains an appraisal of corporate culture on three levels&#x2014;behaviors, values, and shared assumptions&#x2014;and shows how each level affects change initiatives. Providing a clear understanding of the nitty gritty of culture dynamics, this essential resource is filled with new illustrative case studies that clearly show what successful change looks like and demonstrates how to dismantle an ineffective or dysfunctional culture.</p></p><h2>Numerical Recipes Example Book C (The Art of Scientific Computing)</h2><p>These example books published as part of the Numerical Recipes, Second Edition series are source programs that demonstrate all of the Numerical Recipes subroutines.

They now extend intersubjectivity theory to a rethinking of the foundational pillars of psychoanalytic theory since they have already demonstrated the degree to which psychological theory is influenced by the subjective world of the psychological theorist, explored the various "structures of subjectivity" that organize the subjective world, and applied the intersubjective perspective to a broad array of clinical issues.<br><br>Beginning with an in-depth critique of the concept of the isolated individual mind, Stolorow and Atwood argue that this myth has long obstructed recognition of the intersubjective foundations of psychological life. The authors then proceed to a series of chapters that reframe, from the standpoint of intersubjectivity theory, basic assumptions of the psychoanalytic theory of mental life.&nbsp; Concluding chapters on "varieties of therapeutic alliance" and "varieties of therapeutic impasse" further exemplify the ability of intersubjectivity theory to reorient the psychoanalytic therapist, thus providing fresh strategies for understanding and addressing the most challenging clinical contingencies.<br><br><em>Contexts of Being</em> is the conceptual culmination of Stolorow and Atwood's earlier studies, giving them a forum to explain why the perspective of intersubjectivity cannot be reduced to a clinical sensibility that can be grafted onto existing psychoanalytic theory. Rather, the authors argue, the intersubjective perspective has methodological and epistemological implications that mandate a radical revision of all aspects of psychoanalytic thought. Not only a cogent elaboration of these implications, the volume is also an important first step in effecting the sweeping revision that follows from them.</p><p><p>"This book succeeds admirably in describing an important new viewpoint in psychoanalysis in an easily accessible way.&nbsp; Whatever one's view of the intersubjective approach, this volume ensures that view can be based on its lucid exposition."</p> <p>- Robert Galatzer-Levy, M.D., <em>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</em></p></p><h2>Serial Murderers and their Victims</h2><p>This book provides an in-depth, scholarly, and broad-based examination of serial murderers and their victims. Featuring coverage supported by extensive data and research, the book profiles some of the most prominent murderers of our time, addressing the highest-profile serial killer type--the sexual predator--as well as a wide variety of other types (male, female, team, healthcare, and serial killers from outside the U.S.). Author Eric Hickey examines the lives of over 400 serial murderers, analyzing the cultural, historical, and religious factors that influence our myths and stereotypes of these individuals. He describes the biological, psychological, and sociological reasons for serial murder and discusses profiling and other law enforcement issues related to the apprehension and disposition of serial killers.</p><p>Eric W. Hickey teaches criminal psychology at California State University, Fresno.

Each must learn from the other after they are they are forced by their father's death to leave their home and enter into the contests of polite society. The charms of unsuitable men and the schemes of rival ladies mean that their paths to success are thwart with disappointment but together they attempt to find a way to happiness.</p></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>The Colour Illustrated Hobbit</h2><p><p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable and quiet life. His contentment is disturbed one day when the wizard, Gandalf, and the dwarves arrive to take him away on an adventure.</p><p>Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, when Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a sudden thin ray of red from under the drooping lid of Smaug&#x2019;s left eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the tunnel entrance!</p><p>Whisked from his comfortable hobbit-hole by Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves. Bilbo Baggins finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon...</p></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paperbackISBN&nbsp;978-0-618-26030-0</p><h2>Elementary Algebra: Algebra Within Reach</h2><p>Larson IS student success.

Film scholars will be grateful for its theoretical breadth and acuity; film fans will be happy with the graceful way Bordwell weaves into his chapters an extraordinary amount of telling anecdote; and filmmakers will be thrilled with his wonderfully revealing frame-by-frame analyses of Hong Kong cinema&#39;s most exemplary moments.</p><p>David Bordwell is Jacques Ledoux Professor of Film Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.One of our most inventive film scholars, Bordwell takes on one of the most over-the-top cinemas. For 20 years, the Hong Kong film industry was one of the world's most commercially successful and prolific. Recently Western critics have begun to recognize it as possessing a level of creativity almost equal to its financial success--despite its deep roots in genre traditions aimed at a mass audience, Bordwell examines how these elements interact in Hong Kong films to produce an art that is at the same time both popular and significant. He outlines the history, economics, and production techniques of the Hong Kong studios, particularly focussing on the genres that are most closely associated with their success (the kung-fu film, the swordplay epic, the gangster film, and the urban comedy)...By rooting his analyses in detailed readings of the film texts, he is able to convey--as much as mere words can--how this audaciously visceral cinema works...Bordwell is not well known outside academic film circles, but he should be; perhaps this volume will give him the exposure he deserves. (B�r�nice Reynaud, Live Action Faculty, School of Film/Video, California Institute of the Arts <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>The wildly popular Hong Kong cinema at last inspires an informed analysis. David Bordwell is the most valuable and readable film scholar in America. He makes a persuasive case for Hong Kong movies as great entertainment and sometimes great art. (Roger Ebert, Pulitzer Prize-winning flint critic <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>)<br><br>A must-read for film students as well as Hong Kong movie fans. And for Hong Kong's moviegoers quick to dismiss mass-market productions as too commercial, uninspired or just plain lowbrow, <i>Planet Hong Kong</i> offers inspiration for a rethink on Hong Kong's homegrown film industry. (Tim Youngs <i>dotlove.com</i>)<br><br>When new acolytes of Hong Kong cinema sit down to describe it, normally dry writers get juiced on the energy of the films...They want to convey in words the jolt of discovery, the ecstasy of cultdom...Even a relatively staid critic such as structuralist guru David Bordwell seems to be typing in his shorts, with a beer on his desk, in <i>Planet Hong Kong</i>...Combining the study of film form and movie economics, analysis and field work, [he] cogently evokes what separates Hong Kong's buccaneer directors from Hollywood's current storytellers. (Richard Corliss <i>Time Magazine</i>)<br><br>Rather than simply labeling Hong Kong action movies 'over-the-top,' [Bordwell] offers a close reading of the way they tend to use 'technical tricks'...calling attention to the use of the zoom lens and sound editing as rhythmic devices, rather than simple means of imparting information or telling a story...For all his emphasis on visual style, Bordwell also does justice to the important role of Hong Kong's stars. (Steve Erickson <i>Senses of Cinema</i>)<br><br>David Bordwell is a scholar who writes as a fan. He is in love with the crazy rip-roaring, vulgar confusion that is Hong Kong cinema, but he also knows how and why it works and explains it in words the layman can understand. (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>[This book] is among the best of the recent batch of books on Hong Kong cinema. Much of this ground has been covered before, but Bordwell applies his formalist approach to a broad range of films while never losing sight of the crazy energy that makes them so likeable in the first place. (<i>Film Comment</i>)<br><br>The most sober and thorough book yet on the topic. (Paul F. Duke <i>Variety</i>)<br><br>A valuable book...vividly written and set out in short, punchy chapters with handsome and well-used film stills...Never inclined to interpret films through a social, political or psychological lens, Bordwell prefers to get at the industry, the systems, craft and style that sustain Hong Kong filmmakers. In a sense, he is after the everydayness of an amazingly vital and driven film colony...What fuels <i>Planet Hong Kong</i> and makes it special is Bordwell's critical belief that any self-sustaining commercial cinema is a particular art in itself, and one astonishingly rare in the history of the medium. A film book this good is likewise almost as rare. (Bart Testa <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> 2000-08-19)<br><br>Bordwell has written the first informed analysis of one of the greatest success stories in cinema history: Hong Kong, dominant force in Asian film making and an enormous influence on movies around the world...Bordwell loves Hong Kong movies and writes about them with enthusiasm and flair...[He] never loses sight of the fact that Hong Kong's movies, like Hollywood's, are an immensely successful transcultural, popular-culture art form--almost a contradiction in terms--epitomizing the mystery of the movies.

EFT is a remarkable new technique that uses the body&#39;s natural stress-reduction points. Tapping on these points according to the easy-to-follow EFT &#34;basic recipe&#34; has been demonstrated to rapidly reduce anxiety, depression, phobias, and other conditions.In this accessible text EFT originator Gary Craig takes the reader through the basic steps of identifying the emotional roots of their problems and crafting a combination of words that will trigger a healing response. He then demonstrates the one-minute healing routine that is the basis of EFT and discusses the ways in which EFT can be applied to a variety of common conditions, including pain, fears, addictions and cravings, weight issues, insomnia, and guilt.</p><p>Gary is a Stanford engineering graduate, a Certified Master Practitioner of Neuro Linguistic Pr deeply interested in personal improvement through psychology from an early age.

When Bill Masen wakes up blindfolded in hospital there is a bitter irony in his situation. Carefully removing his bandages, he realizes that he is the only person who can see: everyone else, doctors and patients alike, have been blinded by a meteor shower. Now, with civilization in chaos, the triffids - huge, venomous, large-rooted plants able to &#39;walk&#39;, feeding on human flesh - can have their day...</p><p>THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS<br>A truly scary classic of a world at war with incomprehensible forces. A must read book and, a must see movie.<br><p>--Fred Dodnick, Vice President, Director of Trade Production</p>In 1951 John Wyndham published his novel "The Day of the Triffids to moderate acclaim. Fifty-two years later, this horrifying story is a science fiction classic, touted by "The Times (London) as having "all the reality of a vividly realized nightmare." <br>Bill Masen, bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever. <br>But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.</p><h2>Daddy-Long-Legs and Dear Enemy (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>One of the great novels of American girlhood, Jean Webster's <i>Daddy-Long-Legs</i> (1912) follows the adventures of an orphan named Judy Abbott, whose letters to her anonymous male benefactor trace her development as an independent thinker and writer.

Set in the English Midlands of farmers and village craftsmen at the turn of the eighteenth century, the book relates a story of seduction issuing in &#39;the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis&#39;. But it is also a rich and pioneering record - drawing on intimate knowledge and affectionate memory - of a rural world that we have lost. The movement of the narration between social realism and reflection on its own processes, the exploration of motives, and the constant authorial presence all bespeak an art that strives to connect the fictional with the actual.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The exhilaration that comes from reading Adam Bede Owes its existence to the fact that on every page George Eliot seems absorbed in the process of spiritual discovery. The evocations of bygone rural life for which Adam Bede was so resoundingly praised on its publication in 1859 are charged with a personal passion that intensifies the novel&#39;s outer dramas of seduction and betrayal, and inner dramas of moral growth and redemption.</p><h2>Cases in International Relations: Portraits of the Future (3rd Edition)</h2><p><i>Cases in International Relations</i> challenges students to use international relations theory to explore the most current and pressing issues facing the world.

(Wordsworth Classics of World Literature)</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>James Boswell is for some the ideal scribe, for others a sycophantic toady. Edmund Wilson, for example, memorably labeled him "a vain and pushing diarist." Boswell can even be seen as someone unconsciously intent on undermining his idol in sonorous, balanced sentences. Early on in his massive <i>Life</i>, he puts all manner of ideas into our heads with his boobish attempts to clear the youthful Johnson of potential impropriety: "His juvenile attachments to the fair sex were, however, very transient; and it is certain that he formed no criminal connection whatsoever." And while it's often tempting to ignore Boswell's more personal intrusions and delight solely in the melancholic master's words and deeds, there are suchdelightful admissions as, "I was at this time so occupied, shall I call it? or so dissipated, by the amusements of London that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25..." <p> Samuel Johnson was born in 1709 and died in 1784--a long life, though one marred by depression and fear of death. On April 20, 1764, for example, he declared, "I would consent to have a limb amputated to recover my spirits." Many of the quotes Boswell includes are a sort of greatest hits: Johnson's definitions of oats and lexicographer, his love for his cat Hodge, as well as thousands of bon, and mal, mots. ("Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"; "Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are surprized to find it done at all.") But there are also many unfamiliar pleasures--Boswell's accounts of Johnson's literary industry, including the <i>Dictionary,</i> <i>The Rambler</i>, and <i>Lives of the Poets</i>; Johnson's singular loathing for Scotland and France; and the surprising hints of revelry. Awakened at 3 AM by friends, he greets them with, "What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a frisk with you." This at age 42. Johnson's final years were marked by pain and loneliness but certainly no loss of wit.</p></p><h2>The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed</h2><p><p><strong>In <em>The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed</em>, professors Waltz and Sagan resume their well-known dialogue concerning nuclear proliferation and the threat of nuclear war.</strong></p> Kenneth Waltz, Dean of Realist Theory in international relations at Columbia University, expands on his argument that "more may be better," contending that new nuclear states will use their acquired nuclear capabilities to deter threats and preserve peace. Scott Sagan, the leading proponent of organizational theories in international politics, continues to make the counterpoint that "more will be worse": novice nuclear states lack adequate organizational controls over their new weapons, resulting in a higher risk of either deliberate of accidental nuclear war. Treating issues from the &#x2019;long peace&#x2019; between the United States and Soviet Union made possible by the nuclear balance of the Cold War to more modern topics such as global terrorism, missile defense, and the Indian-Pakistani conflict, <em>The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed</em> is an invaluable addition to any international relations course.</p><p><p><strong>Scott D.

Professors Erikson, Wright, and McIver make the argument that state policies are highly responsive to public opinion, and they show how the institutions of state politics work to achieve this high level of responsiveness. They analyze state policies from the 1930s to the present, drawing from and contributing to major lines of research on American politics. Their conclusions are applied to central questions of democratic theory, and affirm the robust character of state institutions.</p><p>Arguing that they are highly responsive to public opinion, this study analyzes state policies from the 1930s to the present, drawing from and contributing to major lines of research on American politics.

It retains its popularity today, both in the original and in adaptations. As well as being the author of the greatest of all children's plays Barrie also wrote sophisticated social comedy and political satire, much of it now newly topical. The Admirable Crichton and What Every Woman Knows are shrewd and entertaining contributions to the politics of class and gender, while Mary Rose is one of the best ghost stories written for the stage.

Of the books he found time to write, four titles are considered indispensable introductions to his teaching as a whole: <i>How to Know Higher Worlds; An Outline of Esoteric Science; Intuitive Thinking As a Spiritual Path;</i> and <i>Theosophy.</i> With the exception of his <i>Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts</i> and <i>Autobiography,</i> Steiner&#x2019;s writings belong to his earliest work. <br><br> In this classic translation of <i>Theosophy,</i> Steiner brings us a psychology based not on the conventional duality of body and mind, but on the more ancient division of body, soul, and spirit. Steiner offers a detailed description of the functions and organs of the three aspects of the human being, as well as the objective realms to which they belong. Just as the physical body originates in and belongs to the material world, so too do the human soul and spirit belong to their specific realms. These are the dimensions through which all human beings travel in the life after death, and in which&#x2015;after passing the &#x201c;midnight hour&#x201d;&#x2015;we begin to seek our karma and destiny in a new life. <i>Theosophy</i> features one of the most comprehensive and condensed of all Steiner&#x2019;s accounts of these realms, as well as the events our immortal being experiences in passing through them. <br><br> The book ends with a chapter on the modern &#x201c;path of knowledge,&#x201d; in which Steiner describes exercises by means of which everyone can develop the latent powers of perception needed to know the higher worlds.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.<b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Constructing Chicago</h2><p><p>Chicago&#x2019;s impressive industrial expansion in the late nineteenth century convinced most observers that the city was defined by the crass pursuit of wealth and that its architecture was, as described by Lewis Mumford, &#x201c;a brutal network of industrial necessities.&#x201d; In a major new book, Daniel Bluestone disputes this vision of the city. Combining architectural history and cultural analysis, Bluestone explores the creation of Chicago&#x2019;s parks, churches, skyscrapers, and civic buildings. He finds that the structure of the city was influenced as much by the moral, cultural, and aesthetic aspirations of its local elite as by the untempered forces of commerce and capital. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bluestone shows how nineteenth-century Chicago architects and their clients attempted to create a distinctive landscape that could distract residents and visitors form the gritty commercial workings of the city while demonstrating a commitment to urbanism that went beyond the marketplace. He surveys the parks that were created to mediate relations between social classes; the churches relocated in residential areas so that they could avoid the dominance of new downtown buildings; the plans for lakefront civic centers architecturally distinguished from the forms of the city&#x2019;s famous early skyscrapers&#x2015;including the Rookery, the Monadnock, the Columbus Memorial, and the Masonic Temple. And he examines these early Chicago skyscrapers, noting how their monumental entrances, embellished lobbies, artistic elevators, and spacious light courts were designed to soften their commercial edges to recast the city&#x2019;s image, and to cultivate an emerging middle class of white-collar workers. A richly illustrated contribution to urban and architectural history, Bluestone&#x2019;s book is also a perceptive look at central features in the design of this quintessential American city. </p></p><p>Bluestone shows how nineteenth-century Chicago architects and their clients attempted to create a distinctive landscape that could distract residents and visitors from the gritty commercial workings of the city while demonstrating a commitment to urbanism that went beyond the marketplace.</p><h2>All About Light (Rookie Read-About Science: Physical Science: Previous Editions)</h2><p><b>Take a closer look at the science behind this incredible concept.</b><br><br>Rookie Read-About Physical Science series introduces the youngest readers to physical science concepts.

"Light is a form of energy. Energy makes things happen." In the simplest words, these two titles in the Rookie Read-About Science--Physical Science series admirably explain fundamental concepts for the very young. The familiar layout will invite emerging readers. Color photos and just a few sentences in bold type appear on spacious, white pages, and the books themselves are small, square, and easily handled. But it's the surprisingly substantive texts, which draw examples straight from a child's world, that really distinguish these titles. To illustrate the concept of vibration, for example, <i>sound</i> encourages children to touch their throats while singing. Both titles summarize key facts in basic language without condescension: "Light makes shadows. Light makes color." For individual reading or classroom sharing, these are a great springboard for children questioning the "whys" of the world. A final illustrated spread in each book summarizes new vocabulary. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Patrick O&#39;Brian</h2><p><p>The story picks up from the end of 'Blue at the Mizzen' when Jack Aubrey receives the news, in Chile, of his elevation to flag rank: Rear Admiral of the Blue Squadron, with orders to sail to the South Africa station. This novel, unfinished and untitled at the time of O'Brian's death, would have been a chronicle of that mission, and much else besides.The chapters left on O'Brian's death are presented here both in printed version - including his corrections to the typescript - and a facsimilie of his manuscript, which goes several pages beyond the end of the typescript and includes marginal notes by O'Brian.And so this great 'roman fleuve' comes to an end with Jack, with his 'sacred blue flag', sailing through fair, sweet days - Stephen with his dissections and new love, Killick muttering darkly over the toasted cheese... Of course, we would rather have had the whole story; instead we have this proof that O'Brian's powers of observation, his humour and his understanding of his characters were undiminished to the end.</p></p><p><p>Patrick O'Brian, one of our greatest contemporary novelists, is the author of the acclaimed Aubrey-Maturin tales and the biographer of Joseph Banks and Pablo Picasso. His first novel, Testimonies, and his Collected Short Stories were recently republished by HarperCollins. In 1995, he was the first recipient of the Heywood Hill Prize for a lifetime's contribution to literature. In the same year he was awarded the CBE. In 1997 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters by Trinity College, Dublin. He died in January 2000 at the age of 85.</p>For Aubrey/Maturin addicts, there could be no better gift: a new, albeit incomplete, story with freshly piquant details, wry humor and salty nautical action. Although the official word was that O'Brian had finished the series with 1999's <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>, he was in fact working on a new installment at the time of his death in 2000. This short volume juxtaposes a facsimile of O'Brian's handwritten manuscript of the untitled novel with a printed version of the text, which corresponds to O'Brian's loosely edited, typed pages. As the tale opens, our heroes are off the coast of South America, trying to find a friendly place to put the <i>Surprise</i> in for victuals and water. Jack Aubrey has received the happy news that he has been given the rank of rear admiral of the Blue, and all is well for the time being. But the Catholic locals are surly at best to the mostly Protestant crew. To fix things, Stephen Maturin does some judicious buttering up and Aubrey reunites with Samuel Mputa, the region's Papal Nuncio and, incidentally, one of his "indiscretions" from his days as "a long-legged youth" serving on the South African station. The typescript of the third chapter ends mid-sentence, but the handwritten manuscript continues on to include a duel between Maturin and a romantic rival, leaving readers begging for more. Alas, this fragmentary but worthy addition to the series is truly the end of a literary era, leaving only readers' imaginations to fill in the rest of the story. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The roots of our family tree reach back millions of years to the beginning of life on earth. Open this family album and embark on an amazing journey. You'll meet some of our oldest relatives--from both the land <i>and</i> the sea--and discover what we inherited from each of them along the many steps of our wondrous past. <br> Complete with an illustrated timeline and glossary, here is the story of human evolution as it's <i>never</i> been told before. <br></p><p><b>LISA WESTBERG PETERS </b>is the author of several acclaimed picture books, including <i>Cold Little Duck, Duck, Duck</i> and <i>The Sun, the Wind and the Rain</i>. She lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota.<br><br><b>LAUREN STRINGER </b>has illustrated many well-loved picture books. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. <br>Kindergarten-Grade 3-Evolution is a ticklish topic. It is controversial to some for religious reasons; for others, it is a challenging concept to present to a young audience without losing scientific veracity. For one thing, young children have little concept of time-a million years might be the span between birthdays. For another, the idea of slow, evolutionary change still seems somehow equal to a magician's trick. So, accomplishing a reasonable explanation of a scientific concept and its progress through millennia is worthy of note. Peters's simple text uses the "we/us" format to place Homo sapiens in the "family" of life at its very beginnings. "All of us," she states in the first sentence of the book, "are part of an old, old family," going back to Earth's beginnings. "We've changed a lot since then." Through a simple progression, amply bolstered by Stringer's striking, large acrylics, she traces "our" family tree from unicellular organisms through amphibians, therapsids, and early mammals to early primates, hominids, and our distinct "humanness" today. Enriched by two pages of additional data and a colorful time line, the whole is rounded out by carefully written author and illustrator notes. Simpler than Stephen Webster's The Kingfisher Book of Evolution (2000) and Melvin Berger's How Life Began (Doubleday, 1990; o.p.), and perhaps easier than Joanna Cole's venerable Evolution (Crowell, 1987; o.p.), this book is a wonderful companion to Steve Jenkins's equally attractive Life on Earth (Houghton, 2002).<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NLP Workbook: A Practical Guide to Achieving the Results You Want</h2><p><p>A practical, creative guidebook to achieving the results you want using Neuro Linguistinc Programming techniques</p><p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming is based on the idea that the human mind is a sort of computer &#x2013; our verbal and body language are the programmes which allow us to change our own thoughts and influence other people e.g. using body language and speech patterns to create instant rapport with someone else.</p><p>We already use such techniques on a sub-conscious level &#x2013; NLP simply helps us crystalise what we already know.

The cloth cover was exchanged for a paper one, and the colorful illustration and information that appeared on the dust jacket (author, title, publisher, a few lines about the book) was printed directly onto those paper covers. Cheaper paper was used, since these artifacts were no longer expected to form part of a permanent library, but were to be as disposable as a newspaper or magazine. And they were cheap: a 25-cent price made books affordable for a huge portion of the population. They became immeasurably successful almost overnight.</p><p> Today many of those books are highly sought-after collectors' items. In spite of the huge numbers printed, they are scarce now simply because almost no one ever thought to save them in colorful, pristine condition. <i>The Great American Paperback</i> illustrates in glorious full color more than 600 of the most interesting and collectable paperbacks, each with an informative caption that provides as much fascinating anecdotal information as the text, which is a masterly and scholarly history of the American paperback, tracing its roots to the early 19th century and concluding with a look at the future.</p><p> There are samples of the paperback originals of Ed McBain, Richard Stark, Jim Thompson, Harlan Ellison, and James M. Cain, as well as illustrations of such rarities as <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, which was issued as a paperback with a dust jacket, and Ellery Queen's <i>Halfway House</i>, which was offered in two formats by the publisher, one bound the usual way, the other bound at the top edge.</p><p> If this massive work hadn't been produced in Hong Kong, it would have cost twice as much and is, believe it or not, a bargain, even at a price as hefty as the book itself. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>The story of American paperback publishing is told by Richard A.

Despite a talent for writing and acting, Williams flunked out of a local junior college after his first year. He reluctantly joined the war effort, enlisting in the Army Air Corps, and managing to write a draft of his first novel while there. Once home, Williams found a small publisher for the novel and enrolled at the University of Denver, where he was eventually to receive both his B.A. and M.A., and where he was to return as an instructor in 1954. Williams remained on the staff of the creative writing program at the University of Denver until his retirement in 1985. During these years, he was an active guest lecturer and writer, publishing two volumes of poetry and three novels, <i>Butcher&#x2019;s Crossing, Stoner</i>, and the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>Augustus</i>.<br><br><b>John McGahern</b> (1934-2006) was one of the most acclaimed Irish writers of his generation. His work, including six novels and four collections of short stories, often centered on the Irish predicament, both political and temperamental. <i>Amongst Women</i>, his best-known book, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and made into a popular miniseries. His last book, the memoir <i>All Will Be Wel</i>l, was published shortly before his death.STONER opens with the declaration that at the time of William Stoner&#39;s death, he had never advanced beyond the rank of assistant professor of English literature and was held in no particular esteem by his colleagues. Few students could even remember him when his name was mentioned. Then John Williams recounts the story of Stoner&#39;s life from the age of 19 to his death, and we find that his life was not ordinary at all. Robin Field fully inhabits Stoner&#39;s character, dragging every morsel of tragedy, inevitability and, occasionally, wiliness and joy from Williams&#39;s understated writing. Field&#39;s performance helps us understand that an ordinary person&#39;s life is still grand, emotional, and worthy. Originally published in 1965 and recently reissued, STONER is a small miracle of a novel that is enhanced by a narrator who is a perfect match. A.B.

In this insightful book, written with dry wit and sharp insight, James C. Cobb explains how the South first came to be seen--and then came to see itself--as a region apart from the rest of America.<br><br>As Cobb demonstrates, the legend of the aristocratic Cavalier origins of southern planter society was nurtured by both northern and southern writers, only to be challenged by abolitionist critics, black and white. After the Civil War, defeated and embittered southern whites incorporated the Cavalier myth into the cult of the "Lost Cause," which supplied the emotional energy for their determined crusade to rejoin the Union on their own terms. After World War I, white writers like Ellen Glasgow, William Faulkner and other key figures of "Southern Renaissance" as well as their African American counterparts in the "Harlem Renaissance"--Cobb is the first to show the strong links between the two movements--challenged the New South creed by asking how the grandiose vision of the South's past could be reconciled with the dismal reality of its present. The Southern self-image underwent another sea change in the wake of the Civil Rights movement, when the end of white supremacy shook the old definition of the "Southern way of life"--but at the same time, African Americans began to examine their southern roots more openly and embrace their regional, as well as racial, identity. As the millennium turned, the South confronted a new identity crisis brought on by global homogenization: if Southern culture is everywhere, has the New South become the No South?<br><br>Here then is a major work by one of America's finest Southern historians, a magisterial synthesis that combines rich scholarship with provocative new insights into what the South means to southerners and to America as well.<br></p><p><br><strong>James C. Cobb</strong> is B. Phinizy Spalding Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Georgia. A former president of the Southern Historical Association, he has written numerous of award-winning books and articles, including <em>The Most Southern Place on Earth</em>, which was a finalist for a <em>Los</em> <em>Angeles Times</em> Book Award.<br><br>"Cobb takes over 200 years of southern intellectualism and condenses it into a readable history of southern history....An accessible, wide-ranging picture of southern identity, useful for students, professionals, and those generally interested in how the South sees itself."--Matthew L. Downs, <em>Southern Historian</em><p></p><br>"The inhabitants of <em>Away Down South</em> come at us thick and fast, benighted and bemused, roaring down some unpaved back-country road, pedal to the metal. If this sounds like a breathless rendition of Southern history by an academic who loves to name names, it certainly is. Still, no one remotely interested in the South will be able to resist this book, and readers are bound to learn from Cobb's enormous erudition."--Ira Berlin, <em>The Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"In this riveting read, Cobb charts the twisting, shifting history of Southern identity and how folks, Southern and non-Southern, have thought about the region....Hopefully, he has a sequel planned."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"If South-gazing is your bag, <em>Away Down South</em> is your book....With C. Vann Woodward's death, Cobb is perhaps our best historical interpreter of the South and this may be his best book, better even than his fine book about the Mississippi Delta....Not only has he done his homework, he has reflected deeply and the result is mature (as in good wine), mellow, stylish and tasty."--Edwin M. Yoder Jr., <em>Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"In this comprehensive, thoughtful, and utterly fascinating account, Cobb stalks the elusive mind--or rather minds--of the South. I don't use the word 'masterpiece' often, but it's the right word here."--John Shelton Reed, author of <em>My Tears Spoiled My Aim: And Other Reflections on Southern</em> <em>Culture</em><p></p><br>"A special treasure for all of us who have loved, studied, and tried to understand the South, a wonderfully complicated part of our country which--despite the changes chronicled in Jim Cobb's fine work--still more than any other region, thinks of itself as being different and special. <em>Away Down</em> <em>South</em> provides not only context and perspective but Cobb's own unique and powerful insights into the South's inherent contradictions."--Hamilton Jordan<p></p><br>"If you want to know what makes the South tick, you might well look to James C. Cobb for insight. For that matter, if you want to understand the inner workings of the contemporary United States, <em>Away Down South</em> would be a good place to start."--John Egerton, author of <em>The Americanization of Dixie:</em> <em>The Southernization of America</em><p></p><br>"A tour de force from one of the South's premier historians. James Cobb shows, with characteristic wity and acuity, how a distinctive regional identity from the time of Jamestown to the Iraq war depended not just on how white and black southerners thought of themselves, but also on what others thought of Dixie."--Anthony J. Badger, author of <em>The New Deal: The Depression Years 1933- 1940</em> and co-author of <em>Race in the American South</em><p></p><br>"<em>Away Down South</em> exemplifies the many bonds that connect Southern history and American Studies....Cobb combines skillful literary interpretation with analysis of social structure, and unites a deeply felt commitment to social and racial justice with rigorous standards of scholarship. He ends with a forceful argument against the use of history in identity politics and vice versa, the immense value of which separation his own book serves to illustrate."--Matthew Mancini, <em>American Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450-1680: Volume One: The Lands below the Winds</h2><p>Between the fifteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, when the Renaissance and early capitalism were transforming Europe, changes no less dramatic were occurring in Southeast Asia. This diverse tropical region was integrated into a global trade system, while trade-based cities came to dominate its affairs. Its states became more centralized and absolutist, and its people adopted scriptural faiths of personal morality. The pace of these changes finds parallels only in our own era. <br><br>Anthony Reid has analyzed and vividly portrayed this Southeast Asian Age of Commerce in two volumes. The first volume, published in 1988 to great acclaim, explored the physical, material, cultural, and social structures of the region. The concluding volume focuses on the profound changes that defined the Age of Commerce as a period. The spice trade that animated the global boom of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries made possible revolutionary changes in urbanization, commercialization, state structure, and belief. Islam, Christianity, and Theravada Buddhism made rapid gains in alliance with the new states. Reid discerns common ground between these developments and the forces transforming Europe and Japan but identifies particular limitations on the growth of private capital and the stability of states in Southeast Asia. A final chapter explores the crisis in the mid-seventeenth century that disengaged Southeast Asians from the world economy for the next three centuries.<br><br><b>Anthony Reid</b> is professor of Southeast Asian history, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University.<br></p><p>$25. hist Southeast Asian societies, like those of East Asia, had developed greatly before European seafarers arrived. It was a region that "was subject to many of the same climatic, physical, and commercial pressures and thus developed a very similar set of material cultures." Reid gives numerous contemporary foreign accounts of life in Southeast Asia on the eve of western imperialism and colonialism in a skillful, analytical, and critical way. The bibliography is excellent, and many of the drawings are from contemporary sources. Highly recommended for academic/research collections. Kenneth W. Berger, Duke Univ.

The book is suitable for use as a textbook for graduate courses in applied mathematics or cognate fields. It is written in a readable style, with considerable motivation and many insightful examples. ... Overall, the book provides a very accessible, up-to-date and comprehensive introduction to applied dynamical systems." (P.E.

As such, she has served as a model and inspiration for women from all the Buddhist traditions who have sought to revive the practice of women's monasticism in modern times. Though her renown as a teacher is widespread, few know the truly amazing details of her life before her monastic ordination at the age of fifty-eight. And what a life it was. Born Ilse Kussel in Berlin, Germany, she grew up in a prosperous Jewish family that was broken up by Nazi terror in 1938. The story of her escape alone to Scotland, and her journey to rejoin her family in China, would be enough for a thrilling adventure novel in itself&#x2014;but it is only the beginning of the story. Her later adventures included&#x2014;but were not limited to&#x2014;surviving the Japanese invasion of China; living the life of a suburban housewife in Los Angeles, California; journeying up the Amazon; studying in a Bolivian university; building a power plant in Pakistan; and establishing the first organic farm in Australia. Her Buddhist practice was a result of a pursuit of the spiritual life that began in her forties when she encountered spiritual teachers in India. She eventually founded a monastery in Sri Lanka, from where, through her books, and her teaching travels, she became one of the most widely respected of contemporary teachers, particularly skilled in interpreting the Buddhist teachings for her fellow Westerners.</p><p>You can imagine how their eyes grow round when Ayya Khema's students are treated to tidbits of her life. "There was that time with the anaconda in Brazil.... We crashed on a cliffside Himalayan road on our way to meet the mir of Hunza.... Torched by rebels, and I had to decide what to do with my nuns on our island..." Of course, her students badger her to write a book. The Jewish/German refugee, California housewife, Australian farmer, global nomad, and Buddhist nun comes through with a quiet, methodical story, that, if written in any other way, would seem more hyperbole than biography.<p> At the age of 55, when most people are mulling how many tulip bulbs to plant for next spring, Ayya Khema took Buddhist vows. She then established three monasteries, arranged Buddhist women's conferences, and gave teachings on a lost meditation technique at venues around the world. And that's only the second half of the book. With 25 titles to her credit and an established reputation, Ayya Khema hardly needed more publicity. Fortunately, she gave in to her students' goading, offering not only a fast-paced story but a model of freedom, energy, and accomplishment. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Ven. Ayya Khema was born into a Jewish family in Berlin in 1923. After leading an active life in the world&#x2014;including marriage and children in America and adventure in South America, Asia and Australia&#x2014;she turned seriously to spiritual practice in her forties. In 1979, she was ordained a Theravadin Buddhist nun, receiving the name <i>khema,</i> meaning "safety and security" <i>(ayya</i> means "sister"). Ayya Khema established a forest monastery near Sidney, Australia; a training center for nuns in Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Buddha-Haus, a meditation center in the Allg�u, Germany. Among her books are <i>When the Iron Eagle Flies; Being Nobody, Going Nowhere; </i>and<i> Who is My Self?; </i>and an autobiography, <i>I Give You My Life. </i> She passed away in 1997.</p><h2>Strategic Planning for Nonprofit Organizations: A Practical Guide and Workbook, Second Edition</h2><p><b>Your total guide to putting a powerful management tool to work in your organization</b> <p>Why strategic planning?

Thomas Moore, an internationally renowned theologian and former Catholic monk, offers a philosophy for living that involves accepting our humanity rather than struggling to transcend it. By nurturing the soul in everyday life, Moore shows how to cultivate dignity, peace, and depth of character. For example, in addressing the importance of daily rituals he writes, "Ritual maintains the world's holiness. As in a dream a small object may assume significance, so in a life that is animated by ritual there are no insignificant things." This is the eloquence that helped reintroduce the sacred into everyday language and contemporary values.<strong>Appearing on bestseller lists across the country, this book provides a powerful spiritual uplift for our troubled times.</strong> <p> <i>Care of the Soul </i>offers a completely new way of thinking about daily life-the everyday activities, events, problems and creative opportunities. It proposes a therapeutic lifestyle that focuses on looking more deeply into emotional problems and sensing sacredness in ordinary things. </p><p> Thomas Moore bases his writing on the ancient model of "care of the soul," which provided a religious context for viewing the everyday events of life. Bringing "care of the soul" into the 20th century, he promises to deepen and broaden the reader's perspective on his or her own life experiences.

Budding roboticists will learn how to create working models of robotic hands and arms, write "pencil and paper" computer programs, and design circuits that light up or make noise when sensors are activated. They'll also find out how other fields like chemistry, biology, and psychology are contributing to new breakthroughs, and see how artists, musicians and fashion designers are using robotics technology in their own work. <i>Robotics: Discover the Science and Technology of the Future</i> opens the door to the all-important STEM subjects -- Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math -- while engaging kids in activities that let them use all their talents to come up with creative solutions to tricky problems and figure out how things work.</p><p>Real robots are among the most advanced machinery ever built. But the most interesting thing I learned putting this book together is that robot researchers and hobbyists use simple robotic models to help them understand and improve their designs. I hope my book will serve as a true introduction to robotics for kids (and adults) who know nothing about electronics. By building simple projects (including a few electronic hacks) you'll come away with an idea of what's going on behind all that complicated circuitry. But you'll also see how technology opens the door for creativity and innovation -- a true melding of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) with Art to create STEAM education! <br><br>You can find out more about the projects in this book, and news about robotics in general, on my website Crafts for Learning and on the Amazing Robotics Projects page on Facebook!<p>Once, robots were only found in science fiction books and movies. Today, robots are everywhere! They assemble massive cars and tiny computer chips. They help doctors do delicate surgery. They vacuum our houses and mow our lawns. Robot toys play with us, follow our commands, and respond to our moods. We even send robots to explore the depths of the ocean and the expanse of space. In <i>Robotics</i>, children ages 9 and up learn how robots affect both the present and the future, as well as the science and technology behind these fascinating creations. Hands-on activities make learning both fun and lasting.<br><br><i>Robotics</i> meets common core state standards in language arts for reading informational text and literary nonfiction and is aligned with Next Generation Science Standards.

The first chapter introduces basic terminology, provides a brief historical sketch, and identifies some excellent texts for background reading. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss the mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation for nonsilicate and silicate systems. Chapter 4 deals with stabilization and gelation of sols. Chapter 5 reviews theories of gelation and examines the predicted and observed changes in the properties of a sol in the vicinity of the gel point. Chapter 6 describes the changes in structure and properties that occur during aging of a gel in its pore liquor (or some other liquid). The discussion of drying is divided into two parts, with the theory concentrated in Chapter 7 and the phenomenology in Chapter 8. The structure of dried gels is explored in Chapter 9. Chapter 10 shows the possibility of using the gel as a substrate for chemical reactions or of modifying the bulk composition of the resulting ceramic by performing a surface reaction (such as nitridation) on the gel. Chapter 11 reviews the theory and practice of sintering, describing the mechanisms that govern densification of amorphous and crystalline materials, and showing the advantages of avoiding crystallization before sintering is complete. The properties of gel-derived and conventional ceramics are discussed in Chapter 12. The preparation of films is such an important aspect of sol-gel technology that the fundamentals of film formation are treated at length in Chapter 13. Films and other applications are briefly reviewed in Chapter 14.<br><br>Materials scientists and researchers in the field of sol-gel processing will find the book invaluable.</p><p>C. Jeffrey Brinker is widely recognized for his pioneering work in sol-gel chemistry - the formation of ceramic materials from molecular precursors. His initial efforts addressed the processing of highly refractory glasses like fused silica at remarkably low temperatures - less than half that of conventional melt-processing. He then turned his attention to the preparation of porous materials useful for a wide range of applications including antireflective coatings, sensors, membranes, adsorbents, and thermal and acoustic insulation. Through exploitation of the scaling relationships of mass and size of fractal objects, he devised a fractal engineering approach to tailor the porosity and pore size of these materials. This early work culminated in the publication of Sol-Gel Science in 1990 (with co-author George Scherer), a book that remains the most highly cited reference in this rapidly growing field.<br><br>From 1974 to 1985, Professor George W. Scherer was at Corning Glass Works, where his research included optical fiber fabrication, viscous sintering, and viscoelastic stress analysis. The latter work was the subject of his first book, Relaxation in Glass and Composites (Wiley, 1986). From 1985 through 1995, he was a member of the Central Research Department of the DuPont Company, where his work dealt principally with sol-gel processing, and especially with drying. In collaboration with Jeff Brinker of Sandia National Labs, he wrote a book entitled Sol-Gel Science (Academic Press, 1990). He is a fellow of the American Ceramic Society and a member of the Materials Research Society, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Concrete Institute, and RILEM. In 1997 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. In February, 1996, he became a full professor in the Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at Princeton University, and a member of the Princeton Materials Institute (now, PRISM). His research involves mechanisms of deterioration of concrete and stone, particularly by crystallization of ice and salts in the pores.</p><h2>Student Activites Manual for Rusch&#39;s Fuentes: Conversacion y gram�tica, 5th Edition</h2><p>The Workbook section of the Student Activities Manual provides additional practice for reading, writing, and culture as well as for reinforcement of the grammar and vocabulary topics presented in Fuentes: Conversacion y gram�tica.

Now this groundbreaking new translation--the first to be based on the original text published in November 1899--brings us a more readable, more accurate, and more coherent picture of Freud's masterpiece.<br> The first edition of <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> is much shorter than its subsequent editions; each time the text was reissued, from 1909 onwards, Freud added to it. The most significant, and in many ways the most unfortunate addition, is a 50-page section devoted to the kind of mechanical reading of dream symbolism--long objects equal male genitalia, etc.--that has gained popular currency and partially obscured Freud's more profound insights into dreams. In the original version presented here, Freud's emphasis falls more clearly on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Without the strata of later additions, readers will find here a clearer development of Freud's central ideas--of dream as wish-fulfillment, of the dream's manifest and latent content, of the retelling of dreams as a continuation of the dreamwork, and much more. Joyce Crick's translation is lighter and faster-moving than previous versions, enhancing the sense of dialogue with the reader, one of Freud's stylistic strengths, and allowing us to follow Freud's theory as it evolved through difficult cases, apparently intractable counter-examples, and fascinating analyses of Freud's own dreams.<br> The restoration of Freud's classic is a major event, giving us in a sense a new work by one of this century' most startling, original, and influential thinkers.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>Introducing Nietzsche: A Graphic Guide</h2><p>Why must we believe that God is dead? Can we accept that traditional morality is just a &#39;useful mistake&#39;? Did the principle of &#39;the will to power&#39; lead to the Holocaust? What are the limitations of scientific knowledge? Is human evolution complete or only beginning? It is difficult to overestimate the importance of Friedrich Nietzsche for our present epoch. His extraordinary insights into human psychology, morality, religion and power seem quite clairvoyant today: existentialism, psychoanalysis, semiotics and postmodernism are plainly anticipated in his writings - which are famously enigmatic and often contradictory. &#34;Introducing Nietzsche&#34; is the perfect guide to this exhilarating and oft-misunderstood philosopher.</p><p>Laurence Gane read Philosophy at UCL and King&#39;s College, London.

Sweeping us into the inner sanctum of Boston society, into the Beacon Hill town houses and exclusive private clubs where only the city&#39;s wealthiest and most powerful congregate, the novel gives us -- through the story of one family and its patriarch, the recently deceased George Apley -- the portrait of an entire society in transition. Gently satirical and rich with drama, the novel moves from the Gilded Age to the Great Depression as it projects George Apley&#39;s world -- and subtly reveals a life in which success and accomplishment mask disappointment and regret, a life of extreme and enviable privilege that is nonetheless an imperfect life.</p><p>John P.

Non-Muslim readers will certainly benefit from the general explanation of interpretation and commentary on the Qur'an, as well as the clear explication of how the text is presented in this edition. And here I compliment you on presenting a clearly Islamic understanding of the text which neither panders to political correctness nor seeks unnecessary conflict or confrontation with non-Muslim communities.

With careful, unobtrusive art, Mr. Maxwell has made us feel all the coldness and hardness and darkness of Chicago, the prosaic surface of existence which seems to stretch about one like asphalt or ice. But there are moments when the author breaks away into a kind of poetic reverie that shows he is able to find a way out.'<br><br>That reverie and the solid social context in which it is embedded added The Folded Leaf to the select company of the few classic novels about adolescent life. To make it available again is not only an act of homage but an acknowledgement of its permanent value.</p><p>assic novel from one of our most honored writers--the author of such acclaimed works as So Long, See You Tomorrow and All the Days and Nights.&#34; The Folded Leaf is the serenely observed yet deeply moving story of two boys finding one another in the Midwest of the 1920s, when childhood lasted longer than it does today and even adults were more innocent of what life could bring.<p>William Maxwell was born in 1908, in Lincoln, Illinois. When he was fourteen his family moved to Chicago and he continues his education there and at the University of Illinois.&nbsp; After a year of graduate work at Harvard he went back to Urbana and taught freshman composition, and then turned to writing.&nbsp; He has published six novels, three collections of literary essays and reviews, and a book for children.&nbsp; For forty years he was a fiction editor at <i>The New Yorker. </i>From 1969 to 1972 he was president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters,&nbsp; He received the Brandeis Creative Arts Award Medal and, for <i>So Long, See You Tomorrow,</i>&nbsp; the American Book Award and the Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Among the topics it addresses are who should be identified as disabled; whether disability is biomedical, social or both; what causes disability and what could 'cure' it; and whether scientific efforts to eliminate disabling physical conditions are morally justified.<br> <br> Wendell provides a remarkable look at how cultural attitudes towards the body contribute to the stigma of disability and to widespread unwillingness to accept and provide for the body's inevitable weakness.</p><p>&#39;The Rejected Body is a brilliant and original work that goes beyond the topic of disability and questions the adequacy of feminist theories of embodiment generally.&#39;--Sandra Lee Bartky, University of Illinois, Chicago<strong>Susan Wendell</strong> is Associate Professor of Women's Studies at Simon Fraser University, British Columbia.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.</p><h2>Collins Bird Guide</h2><p>Written by leading European field ornithologists, this book provides all the information needed to identify any species at any time of the year, with detailed text on size, habitat, range, identification and call.</p><p>Lars Svensson is Europe&#39;s leading field ornithologist.

It charts the early rise of the wristwatch, shows how the cataclysmic events of the 1929 Wall Street Crash unexpectedly led to a golden age of watch production, and demonstrates how the electronic watch, which almost destroyed the traditional industry, led to a mechanical watch renaissance in the last two decades of the 20th century. Each decade opens with an introduction to the era's stylistic and design highlights and then examines the development of specific genres of watches within each period. Hundreds of color photographs in this book feature full page close ups that reveal intricate details of form, texture, and design. Author Alexander Barter's vast knowledge of the 20th-century watch informs his texts which discuss the major technological and design breakthroughs in a chronological format. This book also includes vintage advertisements and other promotional materials, helping to give a sense of the eras in which they were created.

To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. <b>The<br>Executioner's Song</b> is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><i>The Executioner's Song</i> is a work of unprecedented force. It is the true story of Gary Gilmore, who in 1977 became the first person executed in the United States since the reinstitution of the death penalty. Gilmore, a violent yet articulate man who chose not to fight his death-penalty sentence, touched off a national debate about capital punishment. He allowed Norman Mailer and researcher Lawrence Schiller complete access to his story. Mailer took the material and produced an immense book with a dry, unwavering voice and meticulous attention to detail on Gilmore's life--particularly his relationship with Nicole Baker, whom Gilmore claims to have killed. What unfolds is a powerful drama, a distorted love affair, and a chilling look into the mind of a murderer in his countdown with a firing squad."The big book no one but Mailer could have dared. . . . Absolutely astonishing." --Joan Didion, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Literature of the highest order. . . . It lives in the mind long after the last page has been read." --Miami Herald<br><br>"A harrowing, absolutely eyes-on account . . . elevated by Mailer's genius into art." --Houston Chronicle</p><h2>To the Lighthouse (Hogarth paperback series)</h2><p>First published in 1927, this novel draws on the author&#39;s recollections of family holidays at St Ives, Cornwall, although the setting is ostensibly the Hebrides and her parents provided the inspiration for Mr and Mrs Ramsay. The author also wrote &#34;Mrs Dalloway&#34;, &#34;The Waves&#34; and &#34;Orlando&#34;.</p><p>Mrs Ramsay (wife of a distinguished philosopher, mother of eight, and a sympathetic hostess) provides the heartbeat of a shabby-grand holiday house in the Hebrides and at the same time ceaselessly gauges the secret rhythms of its many intertwined pulses. Hers is the dominant interior monologue of this pre-first-world-war interlude. Other voices (most notably that of unmarried artist Lily Briscoe) fade in and out, and Juliet Stevenson turns this haunting story, in which nothing really happens, into a tone-poem of delicately nuanced probings into human relationships. The mood deepens when the neglected house is revisited, post-war, by surviving members of the holiday party, who must ultimately confront 'that loneliness that was the truth about things'. --Karen Robinson, The Sunday Times<br><br>Nicole Kidman in The Hours may have raised the doyenne of Bloomsbury bluestockings literary profile for a new generation of readers, but many people still consider Virginia Woolf's writing difficult and dated. It is. You either go along with descriptions such as, 'the spring, without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields, wide-eyed and watchful, and entirely careless of what was done, or thought, by the beholders...', or you don't. Somehow, though, when it is read in a voice as sensitive and intelligent as Juliet Stevenson's, you appreciate why critics have said that this, her best-known novel, contains some of the most beautiful prose ever written. Just as well, because there isn't much plot. The action, such as it is, takes place in the holiday home of the Ramsay family, on a Hebridean island before and after the great war. Mrs Ramsay is beautiful, Mr Ramsay difficult, their eight children relatively interesting, their house guests more so. It's the relationships that count, constantly shifting and elusive, dependent on a glance, a trick of light, an inflection of tone. Naxos does an abridged version, but don t be tempted. Woolf is all or nothing. --Sue Arnold, The Guardian<br><br>Thinking about my own reaction to To the Lighthouse, I enjoyed it more because of Juliet Stevenson's reading of it. She carried me along in the middle section when I was losing my way. And then I got fired up for it again. What the audiobook did was to impose some additional (and quite helpful) structure on the book. For example the last four tracks are called In the boat, Perspective, Approaching and Arriving. --Pete, Couch trip blogWith introductions by Eavan Boland and Maud Ellmann</p><h2>School Zone - Big Preschool Workbook - 320 Pages, Ages 3 to 5, Colors, Shapes, Numbers, Early Math, Alphabet, Pre-Writing, Phonics, Following Directions, and More (School Zone Big Workbook Series)</h2><p><p>Find our complete line of educational resources at Amazon.com/SchoolZonePublishing.</p> <p><b>BOOK FEATURES</b> </p> <ul> <li>320 pages: 319 activity pages, 1 award certificate</li> <li>For ages 3-5</li> <li>7.75" x 10.75" pages with durable glossy cover</li> <li>Book has 5 sections with Parent notes for each: Pre-writing, Alphabet, Colors &amp; Shapes, Following Directions, Numbers &amp; Early Math</li> <li>The skill being practiced is listed at the bottom of each page</li> <li>Colorful, kid friendly illustrations reinforce the lessons</li> <li>Perforated pages are easy to tear out for individual worksheets</li> </ul> <p><b>AMAZING</b> - Big Preschool Workbook has 300+ colorful exercises that make learning fun!

School ZoneSave I generally have the kids first work on the grade level they ve just completed and then give them a head start for the new school year with the new grade level. I think this banner grabbed from the School Zone Facebook page explains why I do this, perfectly... School ZoneSave The workbooks cover everything from Spelling, Math, Science, Analytic Thinking, Creative Writing, General Knowledge and Social Studies. And this year, they ve introduced Bible Workbooks for Preschoolers to their growing collection of workbooks. School ZoneSave The books in the line include activities like dot-to-dot fun, mazes, alphabet and number recognition and reinforcement, shapes, spot the differences etc. All activities center around a story from the Bible and even include a verse in the same. I ve enjoyed sitting down with my 4 year old, working on activities and sharing our favorite Bible stories. Since he has just begun memorizing a Bible verse each week at a family prayer fellowship we attend, we try to pick a verse to learn from one of the workbooks. School ZoneSave These are great to carry to entertain the kids on a long road-trip/flight or even to a local restaurant, while you wait for the food to come out.

In Relational Cultural Therapy, Judith V. Jordan explores the history, theory, and practice of this relationship-centered, culturally oriented form of therapy. Mainstream western psychological theories generally depict human development as moving from dependence to independence. In contrast, relational cultural therapy is built on the premise that, throughout the lifespan, human beings grow through and toward connection, and that we need connections to flourish, even to stay alive. This theory views isolation as a major source of suffering for people, at both a personal and cultural level. The goal of therapy is to deepen the therapeutic relationship and, ultimately, the client s relationships outside of therapy. Therapy focuses on a client s relational images positive or negative expectations created by past relationships that in turn influence present and future relationships. Negative relational images often cause disconnection between people, so the relational cultural therapist seeks to decrease the effect of these negative images and help the client to become more connected with others. The theory behind this approach centers around positive interpersonal factors such as growth-fostering relationships and mutual empathy as well as cultural factors that facilitate validation and empowerment for marginalized populations. The approach seeks to reduce sources of individual isolation and social injustice, such as racism, classism, and homophobia, which contribute to chronic disconnection. In this book, Dr. Jordan presents and explores this approach, its theory, history, the therapy process, primary change mechanisms, empirical basis, and future developments. This essential primer to relational cultural therapy, amply illustrated with case examples, is perfect for graduate students studying theories of therapy and counseling as well as for seasoned practitioners interested in understanding this approach.</p><p><b>Judith V.

Is the decline in Britain emblematic of the fate of western Christianity? Topical and controversial, <em>The Death of Christian Britain</em> is a bold and original work that will bring some uncomfortable truths to light.</p></p><p>The Church of England is dying, says Callum Brown, in <i>The Death of Christian Britain</i>. So, what's new? The difference, according to the Scottish historian, is in how long it's taken to reach the point of no return. Secularization theory, which emerged with the social sciences in the 19th century, was obsessed with the numbers of people not attending church. As the Industrial Revolution spread, Christians seized upon these numbers to illustrate how godforsaken our cities were becoming. Yet Brown argues this "authorized version" is mistaken. According to him, secularization began when the Beatles were releasing their first single in 1962. Instead of counting heads, he draws on anecdotal and cultural references to argue that Christianity was alive and well until the Swinging '60s. It just wasn't going to church....<p> He sheds fascinating (and sympathetic) light on the history of conversion, social action, and the church's public role in the nation. And his use of gender theory in the study of religion could be revolutionary. This may be a textbook, but it engages the mind and the soul. Sociologists and Christians in particular will be challenged to think harder. For "the Britain of the new millennium is showing the world how religion as we have known it can die." This is bound to unnerve Christians. Many might even take issue with the title, and refuse to read on. But to do so would be folly: a week spent immersed in Brown's book could reap substantially more fruit than a series of revival meetings. <i>--Brian Draper, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>Callum Brown is Professor of Religious and Cultural History at the University of Dundee.

The word Oshun is the name given to describe a complex convergence of Spiritual Forces that are key elements in the If� concept of fertility and the erotic. Those Spiritual Forces that form the foundation of Oshun&#x2019;s in the Spirit Realm relate to the Creation of new forms through the interaction between polar opposites. According to If�, Creation occurs through the polarity between the Forces of expansion and contraction. Together these Forces create light and darkness, which in turn sustains and defines all that is. If� scripture often refers to Forces of expansion as "Orisha Okunrin", which means "Male Spirit" and to Forces of contraction as "Orisha Obinrin", which means "Female Spirit". Both forms of Spiritual Power are considered of equal importance in the evolution of all that exists. One is not better than the other because it is only through the balance of opposites that life comes into Being. <p>This title is part of a series of eight booklets about the Orisha by Awo F�&#x2019; Lokun F�tunmbi.

Author and award-winning scholar-teacher Craig Wright, who has taught Music Appreciation courses for more than 35 years, is consistently praised by reviewers and other professors for his unparalleled accuracy and his clear, direct, conversational style. Throughout the book, Wright connects with today&#39;s students by incorporating comparisons between pop and classical music and by using examples from popular artists to illustrate core concepts. This chronological text succinctly covers traditional Western music from medieval to modern, discussing examples from each historical period within their social contexts and the construction of each piece. LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC is the only text that provides Craig Wright&#39;s own Listening Exercises, in the book and online, which help students focus on important musical elements and episodes. A free CD, packaged with each print copy of the text, includes all of the musical examples for the Part 1 listening exercises. A full set of optional online student resources includes Active Listening Guides, streaming music, an interactive eBook, quizzing, and more--all to challenge your students. All of the music discussed in the text is also available on CD and on Sony Music download cards.</p><p>Craig M. Wright received his Bachelor of Music degree at the Eastman School of Music in 1966 and his Ph.D. in musicology from Harvard University in 1972. He began his teaching career at the University of Kentucky and for the past forty years has been teaching at Yale University, where he is currently the Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Music. At Yale, Wright&#39;s courses include his perennially popular introductory course, Listening to Music (also part of the offerings of Open Yale Courses); his large lecture course Exploring the Nature of Genius; and most recently his Coursera course Introduction to Classical Music. He is the author of numerous scholarly books and articles on composers ranging from Leoninus to Bach. Wright has also been the recipient of many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Einstein and Kinkeldey Awards of the American Musicological Society, and the Dent Medal of the International Musicological Society. In 2004, he was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago. And in 2010 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, joining fellow inductee, banjo player Steve Martin. In addition to LISTENING TO MUSIC and LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC, EIGHTH EDITION, Wright has also published THE ESSENTIAL LISTENING TO MUSIC, SECOND EDITION; LISTENING TO MUSIC, CHINESE EDITION (Schirmer Cengage Learning/Three Union Press, 2012), translated and simplified by Profs. Li Xiujung (China Conservatory, Beijing) and Yu Zhigang (Central Conservatory, Beijing), both of whom worked with Wright at Yale; and MUSIC IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION, MEDIA UPDATE (Schirmer Cengage Learning, 2010), with coauthor Bryan Simms. He is currently at work on a volume titled MOZART&#39;S BRAIN: EXPLORING THE NATURE OF GENIUS."The language used struck us as more accessible and conversational. It lacked, thankfully, the pedantic, overly-academic tone that can be an obstacle to many students. I appreciate the fact that Dr. Wright writes in a way that is easily understood by the non-music major. . . . The three greatest strengths of the text are (1) the easy manner and conversational style with which the material is treated, (2) the more global approach to the music of the 20th century, and (3) the connections to pop music that Dr. Wright makes to illustrate both musical characteristics and context."<br><br>"Strengths: 1.The numerous additional listening selections AND listening guides online. Excellent for those serious students who would go the extra mile. 2.Even though I currently do not have use for it, I am sure instructors in general appreciates the online grading for the listening exercises. 3. Reference to current developments and personalities."<br><br>"The organization of LISTENING TO MUSIC is excellent and it is a good survey of Western Art Music."<br><br>"The first chapter is far superior [to the text in use]. I feel that students need an explanation of the current state of popular music with comparisons to the past. . . . Today's students are engrossed in pop music and do not have even a basic understanding of why things are. Because students are entrenched in pop music, many of them are not interested into delving into topics that challenge the ideologies they are accustomed too.

But why&#x2015;a century after Dada and Surrealism's first systematic enquiries&#x2015;does chance remain a key strategy in artists' investigations into the contemporary world? The writings in this anthology examine the gap between intention and outcome, showing it to be crucial to the meaning of chance in art. The book provides a new critical context for chance procedures in art since 1900 and aims to answer such questions as why artists deliberately set up such a gap in their practice; what new possibilities this suggests; and why the viewer finds the art so engaging.</p><p>Artists surveyed include Vito Acconci, Bas Jan Ader, Francis Al�s, William Anastasi, John Baldessari, Walead Beshty, Mark Boyle, George Brecht, Marcel Broodthaers, John Cage, Sophie Calle, Tacita Dean, Stan Douglas, Marcel Duchamp, Brian Eno, Fischli &amp; Weiss, Ceal Floyer, Huang Yong Ping, Douglas Huebler, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Jiri Kovanda, Jorge Macchi, Christian Marclay, Cildo Meireles, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Gabriel Orozco, Cornelia Parker, Robert Rauschenberg, Gerhard Richter, Daniel Spoerri, Wolfgang Tillmans, Keith Tyson, Jennifer West, Ceryth Wyn Evans, La Monte Young Writers include Paul Auster, Jacquelynn Baas, Georges Bataille, Daniel Birnbaum, Claire Bishop, Guy Brett, Benjamin H.

But bound by tradition we often resist the very change our congregations need to thrive. Our challenge: revitalize our congregations and create a new center, one that will give church leaders a solid foundation for growing and reinvigorating congregations in the joyful spirit of Christianity. Written by three distinguished church consultants, Leading Congregational Change offers proven processes and tools for accomplishing this goal and revitalizing churches of any size and across the broad spectrum of denominations.With this much-needed handbook, the authors brilliantly combine their experience guiding dozens of churches through the change process with both the study of Christian disciplines and the sophisticated understanding of such important business thinkers as John Kotter on leading change and Peter Senge on learning organizations. In this eminently readable book the authors have distilled their insights and practices into simple but powerful concepts for leading congregations, whether long established or recently formed, through profound change.The central component of their original change model is for congregations to first nurture spiritual and relational vitality-that is, the creative power that faithful people experience together as they passionately pursue God&#39;s vision for their lives. Then, drawing examples from thriving churches, the authors offer long-term support for building upon this kind of vitality through eight well-considered stages. These include personally preparing for change, creating a sense of energy and urgency, and establishing a &#34;vision community&#34;-a diverse group of key members who work together to collaboratively discern and shape the church vision, share it with the broader congregation, and implement it through specific action plans.Recognizing that individual and church transformation go hand in h<b>JIM HERRINGTON</b> is executive director of Mission Houston, an interdenominational, multicultural pastoral effort to transform the city of Houston. <p><b>MIKE BONEM</b> is president and cofounder of Kingdom Transformation Partners, a church consulting and training firm based in Houston.</p> <p><b>JAMES H.

Now shielded by law as an endangered species, they reawaken an ancient hatred that will tear a family, and ultimately the town, apart.<br><br>At the center of the storm is Helen Ross, a twenty-nine-year-old wolf biologist sent alone into this remote and hostile place to protect the wolves from those who seek to destroy them. <i>The Loop</i> charts her struggle, and her dangerous love affair with the son of her most powerful opponent, the brutal and charismatic rancher Buck Calder. <br><br>A haunting exploration of man's conflict with nature and the wild within himself, an epic story of deadly passions and redemptive love set against the grandeur of the American West, <i>The Loop</i> is destined to capture the hearts and imaginations of readers everywhere.</p><p>Things aren't going too well for wolf biologist Helen Ross. At 29, she's unemployed (recently retired dishwasher), single (boyfriend of two years left <i>her</i> for Africa), and has just learned that her father is marrying someone younger, richer, and prettier than herself (completely accurate). Back in her lonely log cabin in Cape Cod, frantically chain-smoking, she receives a message from her former lover Dan Prior. Prior, also a biologist, works for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service wolf-recovery program. In return for helping him track the lupine posse, Prior will provide her with a cabin, truck, and a snowmobile for good measure in a rustic little town called Hope, just outside of Helena, Montana. Apparently, Ross has never heard the proverb "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," and happily skips off to Big Sky Country.<p> Within moments of her arrival, she finds out what she's up against: a small town with a long history of wolf fear and loathing, no resources (big surprise), and a powerful rancher who will do whatever it takes to eliminate the wolves. The rancher, testosterone-saturated Buck Calder, has got the community riled up after a wolf stalked his daughter's home and killed the family dog. He won't stop until every last endangered wolf is dead, which proves problematic for Ross when she decides to romance his 18-year-old son, Luke. Cynics be warned: their love affair spawns a trove of gooey pillow talk and syrupy prose. Even so, Evans has made impressive strides as a writer since his debut novel, <i>The Horse Whisperer</i>, and his storytelling has reached a noticeably new level of sophistication: the plot is tight, the characterization is realistic, and the dialogue is crisp. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>An extraordinary new novel of love, family, and man's struggle with the wild<p>A pack of wolves makes a sudden savage return to the Rocky Mountain ranching town of Hope, Montana, where a century earlier they were slaughtered by the thousands.

But an ancient hatred awaits her in Hope, a hatred that will tear a family and ultimately the community apart. And soon Helen is at the center of the storm, by loving the wrong man, by defying the wrong man...by daring to lead a town out of the violent darkness of its past....</p></p><h2>Interpretation of Cultural and Natural Resources</h2><p>Interpretation offers one of the most demanding, dynamic, and exciting fields of work anywhere.

Although it is close to the <i>Investigations</i> in some points, and to the <i>Phiosophische Bemerkungen</i> at others, the <i>Philosophical Grammar</i> is an independent work which covers new ground. It is Wittgenstein's fullest treatment of logic and mathematics in their connection with his later understanding of 'proposition', 'sign', and 'system'. He also discusses inference and generality - critisizing views of Frege and Russell as well as earlier views of his own - and the treatment of mathematical proof in this book, especially of inductive or recursive proofs, is deeper and more extensive than previously.<b>Rush Rhees</b> was in the Department of Philosophy at University College, Swansea, Wales. <b>Anthony Kenny</b> was a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.</p><h2>Essentials of Wine With Food Pairing Techniques, The</h2><p>Designed for a variety of audiences, this book combines a framework for understanding wine and making intelligent food pairing decisions. &nbsp;By emphasizing the basics of wine and the basics of food pairing techniques, it offers content that is relevant to novice and intermediate&nbsp;readers and restaurateurs.

Tour.</p><p>A perfect amount of time has elapsed for beginning a proper historical understanding of Jimmy Carter--enough to allow the emotions of witnesses and participants to cool, but not enough to overly dim their recall. And this book is a solid effort in that direction. Bourne, a psychiatrist, had known Carter for years before his presidency and followed him to the White House. (Which he left after getting caught prescribing drugs under a false name for one of his staffers.) This book is full-scale: it starts with Carter ancestors in 1635 and proceeds to describe in some detail the hard times characteristic of a place like Sumter County, Georgia. In Bourne's view, Carter's meteoric rise is best understood as the successive mastery of the narrow cultures of local, state, and national politics by a proud, intelligent man who had seen and understood the wider world (at the Naval Academy and then in nuclear submarines) before coming back to take over the family farm after his father's death. How meteoric? Well, Bourne tells us, Carter was elected President less than four years after stumping the panel on <i>What's My Line?</i>.Peter G.

Focusing on the artist&#x2019;s working methods and preparatory drawings, the book also explores Bingham&#x2019;s representations of people and places and situates these images in a dialogue with other contemporary depictions of the region. Of particular note are two landmark essays investigating Bingham&#x2019;s creative process through comparisons of infrared images of 17 of his paintings with both his preparatory drawings and the completed works, casting new light on his previously understudied process. Technical analysis of the artist&#x2019;s lauded masterpiece, <i>Fur Traders Descending the Missouri</i>, reveals Bingham&#x2019;s considerable revisions to the painting. In the concluding essay, the 20th-century revival of the artist&#x2019;s work is discussed within the context of American Regionalism and in light of a shifting sequence of narratives about the nation&#x2019;s past and future.</p><p>A new look at George Caleb Bingham&#x2019;s iconic river paintings with a focus on the artist&#x2019;s process through his preparatory drawings and infrared imaging of his river pictures.&nbsp;<br><b>Nenette Luarca-Shoaf</b> is visiting research associate at the McNeil Center for Early American Studies. <b>Claire Barry</b> is director of conservation at the Kimbell Art Museum. <b>Nancy Heugh</b> is paper conservator and <b>Janeen Turk</b> is assistant curator of American art, both at the Saint Louis Art Museum. <b>Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser</b> is curator of American paintings and sculpture and <b>Dorothy Mahon</b> is conservator, both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. <b>Andrew J.

During the Company Wars, <i>Finity's End</i> had to leave a pregnant crew member on Pell and was unable to retrieve her orphaned son. <p> The Neiharts want their lost cousin back out of love, but also because the war has cost <i>Finity's End</i> a generation. No babies have been born, while half the crew--half the family--are dead, making the prodigal youth even more precious. </p><p> But Fletcher Neihart has left Pell for the planet Downbelow where, after a childhood spent in uncaring foster homes, he's found happiness working with the <i>hisa</i>--Downbelow's mystic, peaceful natives. He even has a beautiful girlfriend. The last thing he wants is to be dragged into space. He has no choice. </p><p> Fletcher is reunited with a home he's never seen. From having no family, he's now surrounded by kinfolk--all battle-scarred strangers more alien than the non-human hisa. Like Jeremy, the hero-worshipping twelve-year-old, JR, groomed to be a captain and growing into leadership, Madelaine, ship's attorney, and Fletcher's great-grandmother. </p><p> And the Neiharts must deal with a resentful hostage who bears their name and features, but knows nothing of their history, traditions or lives. </p><p> Meanwhile, <i>Finity's End</i> flies toward conflict and danger. For Captain Neihart is forging a treaty among the worlds, stations and Merchanters; and opponents will try ambush, sabotage, and murder to stop him. By journey's end the hope for peace will depend on whether JR, Jeremy and the crew can uphold Merchanter honor; and whether Fletcher, guided by a gift from the hisa, can learn to trust... and find his true place in the universe.</p></p><h2>Macroscale and Microscale Organic Experiments (Available Titles CourseMate)</h2><p>The market leader for the full-year organic laboratory, this manual derives many experiments and procedures from the classic Feiser lab text, giving it an unsurpassed reputation for solid, authoritative content.

In this new book, Wurman examines how the Internet, desktop computing, and advances in digital technology have not simply enhanced access to information, but in fact have changed the way we live and work. In examining the sources of information anxiety, Wurman takes an in-depth look at how technological advances can hinder understanding and influence how business is conducted.</p><p>Information might want to be free; but, why should we free it? We've got enough trouble keeping track of all the petabits that already run around untethered, and risk a computer counterrevolution if we let the situation get much crazier. Information architect Richard Saul Wurman swept the field clear in 1989 with his groundbreaking book that foresaw the problems of data clutter and proposed a radical new means of organizing and presenting knowledge humanistically; for the new century, he has revised it substantially as <i>Information Anxiety 2</i>. This book is sparklingly clear and readable--it'd better be, after all--and offers insight not only to designers, educators, and content developers, but also to anyone who needs to communicate effectively through dense clouds of facts. If Wurman occasionally indulges in New Age-y pop psychology, his analysis is never muddy, and the more hardheaded reader will forgive him soon enough. The discussion alternates between describing the deeply stressful task of absorbing poorly organized data and exploring solutions that require a bit of rethinking, but that reward such an investment with improved understanding and, maybe, a state change from information to wisdom. We could do worse--if we don't pay attention to Wurman and his colleagues, we almost certainly will. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Wurman identifies a special ailment of this age of communicationsso-called "information anxiety," caused, in his view, by an overwhelming flood of data, much of it from computers and much of it unintelligible. The author, a graphic artist and architect, argues that "learning is remembering what you are interested in," and proposes to help the anxious individual to select personally relevant information from the body of raw data or "non-information." He also demonstrates how to "access" resources and take advantage of experiences, suggesting specific information-processing skills and media habits. His breezy, colloquial style using short, headlined paragraphs is sprinkled with graphics and notes, imaginative quotes and anecdotes. This stimulating book is worth reading in or out of sequence if only for Wurman's views on education and the need to "transform information into structured knowledge."

Understanding how people think about, experience, and interact with nature is crucial for promoting environmental sustainability as well as human well-being.<br> <br> The book first summarizes theory and research on human cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to nature and goes on to review research on people's experience of nature in wild, managed, and urban settings. Finally, it examines ways to encourage conservation-oriented behavior at both individual and societal levels. Throughout, the authors integrate a wide body of published literature to demonstrate how and why psychology is relevant to promoting a more sustainable relationship between humans and nature.</p><p><b>Susan Clayton</b> is a professor of social psychology at the College of Wooster. Her research aims to understand the ways in which people relate to nature, as well as to investigate broader issues of identity and justice. She is a past president of the Society for Population and Environmental Psychology.<br> <p><b>Olin Eugene (Gene) Myers Jr.</b> is Associate Professor at Huxley College of the Environment at Western Washington University, where he offers courses in conservation psychology, human ecology, environmental ethics, and is extensively involved in undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental education. His research interests are wide-ranging and include psychology and anthrozoology as applied to conservation.</p>"Overall, their book will likely serve as a main textbook for a dedicated course or seminar in conservation psychology. However, the book will also be of great value to researchers and those teaching related courses by providing greater depth of understanding of human drivers of pressing environmental issues." (Landscape Ecol, 2011) <p>"The book is an amply referenced survey, equally suitable as both an undergraduate textbook and a starting point for academics and professionals who wish to know more about how psychological research can inform their conservation work. I highly recommend its use in both of these contexts". (The Journal of Environmental Conservation, 2010)</p> <p>"Conservation Psychology serves its audience and purpose well. It would be an excellent supplementary textbook to many conservation-focused graduate and undergraduate courses. Readers interested in conservation should find this volume fascinating, and will discover new insight into, as the authors note, the psychology of perseverance in the face of difficult times". (The Quarterly Review of Biology, 1 December 2010)</p> <p>&#x201c;I highly recommend their book to psychologists of all creeds as well as to conservation biologists, environmental scientists, policy-makers, teachers, and anyone concerned about our evolving place in nature.&#x201d; (<i>Conservation Psychology</i>, August 2009)</p> <p>"Clayton and Myres have written a timely book. It heralds a new area within psychology. I highly recommend their book to psychologists of all creeds as well as to conservation biologists."</p> <p>Peter Verbeek, Science&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br></p><h2>Reputable Conduct: Ethical Issues in Policing and Corrections (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book looks at the peculiar ethical demands in the policing and corrections professions, with particular emphasis on sub-cultural constraints, and how loyalty to colleagues can sometimes cause a sacrifice of individuality. <b> </b> It contains a unique discussion on whether ethics can be taught, covers sensitive, real-life moral dilemmas and the ever-increasing ethical demands placed upon police and corrections professionals. <b> </b>For Chiefs of Police, Jail Wardens/Superintendents, and Principals of Justice Academies. </p></p><p>Preface <p> Written for students in college criminal justice programs, and for police and corrections officers in training, Reputable Conduct has been designed as a working text rather than a reference book. And while this work combines Dr. Jones' 17 years of experience teaching ethics with Mr. Carlson's 33 years as a law enforcement practitioner and instructor, both acknowledge having been well taught by their many students and colleagues during that time. By design, the writing style and tone of this book are very personal, for as we wrote it, we imagined our students listening in. </p><p> Reputable Conduct is intended to be a friendly and easy-to-read introduction to the difficult and sometimes peculiar ethical demands of the professions of policing and corrections. It addresses some of the characteristics of these roles, with particular emphasis on subcultural constraints, and how loyalty to our colleague group can sometimes cause us to sacrifice our individuality. How these constraints may affect the moral decision making of an officer is looked at in detail in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. </p><p> One unusual feature of the book is the discussion in Chapter 4, which encourages the student to think about the role of the ethics educator. The discussion has been included so that the educator's role can be more clearly understood by the student. I hope this will reduce the possibility of misunderstanding arising between teacher and student regarding the purpose of an ethics course. </p><p> Tools that may be helpful for resolving moral dilemmas are discussed in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 includes several case studies to give students an opportunity to practice using these tools. </p><p> Some of the material in the book could be described as sensitive&#x2014;even controversial&#x2014;in nature. To gain maximum benefit from the experience of working through the book, students are encouraged to consider with an open mind the readings and the Reflections, which are searching questions interspersed throughout each chapter and based on the preceding content. This will require a degree of maturity and discipline. </p><p> Reputable Conduct is designed to provide students with a vehicle to promote private thought and class discussion about issues that&#x2014;from what I have been told by my students and many practitioners over the years&#x2014;are important to the vital roles played in our society by police and corrections officers. </p><p> If such thinking and discussion contribute, even in some small way, to justice continuing to be served, and to the individual officer's sense of well-being being enhanced, then the effort on all our parts will have been justified. Acknowledgments </p><p> It has been a pleasure to work with staff members of Prentice Hall Canada Career &amp; Technology in the writing of this book, my first attempt at such an enterprise. They have been unfailingly helpful, cooperative, and encouraging. </p><p> I wish to acknowledge the early and continuing work of David Stover, acquisitions editor. David has been a gracious contract negotiator and guide. His early suggestions for improving the book were invaluable. Ivetka Vasil, editorial assistant, undertook the review process and kept me informed in a most supportive way. Andrew Winton, production editor, shepherded the book through the production phase and did so with class and a little firmness when it was required. And I wish to acknowledge the expert help and advice of Allyson Latta, whose copyediting contributed greatly to improving the original manuscript. </p><p> Finally, I wish to say how much I valued the feedback received from the external reviewers: Janet Hoffman, Lambton College; Lori Larsen, Lethbridge Community College; Ann Parks, Lethbridge Community College; Rebecca Volk, Algonquin College; Megan Way Nicholson, St. Lawrence College; and Lisa Bezaire, Sir Sandford Fleming College. Their encouraging and constructive comments gave me the will to finish the book, and much food for thought. Some of their suggestions have been incorporated in this edition, and others have been kept on file for inclusion in what, I hope, will be subsequent editions of this book.</p><p>J. R. J.</p><p> <b>Why did a law enforcement officer in a large metropolitan police department brutalize a suspect? Why did it take several days for his colleagues to admit witnessing the event?</b> </p><p> Such questions lead officers to ponder their moral duties and obligation, known generally as ethical considerations as they relate to the law enforcement profession. Some of the hardest decisions law enforcement officers make during their careers involve ethical issues. As a result, the actions taken to resolve these issues play a vital role in defining officers throughout their careers. </p> <p> <i>Reputable Conduct, Second Edition</i> is intended to be a friendly and easy-to-read introduction to the difficult and sometimes peculiar ethical demands of the professions of policing and corrections. </p> <p></p></p><h2>The Cabaret of Plants: Forty Thousand Years of Plant Life and the Human Imagination</h2><p><p><strong>"Highly entertaining...Without being sentimental about it, Mr. Mabey gets us to look at life from the plants' point of view. His science is sound, he's witty, and his language is engaging." &#x2015;Constance Casey, <em>New York Times</em></strong></p><p><em>The Cabaret of Plants</em> is a masterful, globe-trotting exploration of the relationship between humans and the kingdom of plants by the renowned naturalist Richard Mabey.</p><p>A rich, sweeping, and wonderfully readable work of botanical history, <em>The Cabaret of Plants</em> explores dozens of plant species that for millennia have challenged our imaginations, awoken our wonder, and upturned our ideas about history, science, beauty, and belief. Going back to the beginnings of human history, Mabey shows how flowers, trees, and plants have been central to human experience not just as sources of food and medicine but as objects of worship, actors in creation myths, and symbols of war and peace, life and death.</p><p>Writing in a celebrated style that the <em>Economist</em> calls &#x201c;delightful and casually learned,&#x201d; Mabey takes readers from the Himalayas to Madagascar to the Amazon to our own backyards. He ranges through the work of writers, artists, and scientists such as da Vinci, Keats, Darwin, and van Gogh and across nearly 40,000 years of human history: Ice Age images of plant life in ancient cave art and the earliest representations of the Garden of Eden; Newton&#x2019;s apple and gravity, Priestley&#x2019;s sprig of mint and photosynthesis, and Wordsworth&#x2019;s daffodils; the history of cultivated plants such as maize, ginseng, and cotton; and the ways the sturdy oak became the symbol of British nationhood and the giant sequoia came to epitomize the spirit of America.</p><p>Complemented by dozens of full-color illustrations, <em>The Cabaret of Plants</em> is the magnum opus of a great naturalist and an extraordinary exploration of the deeply interwined history of humans and the natural world.</p> 35 color illustrations</p><p>Richard Mabey is the author of Food for Free, Flora Britannica, and Weeds: In Defense of Nature&#x2019;s Most Unloved Plants, among other books.

He lives in Norfolk, England.&#x201c;Mabey&#x2019;s book lets us see plants as subjects rather than objects, arrayed in all their colors, performing miraculous tricks, dances and acrobatics. . . . [His] lyrical prose enlivens the history of botanical understanding . . .

There are so many delights to be found in <em>Cabaret</em>&#x2015;from the hunt for the elusive Amazonian moonflower, to the wonder of self-rejuvenating yews that defy efforts to determine their age, to the sprouting of an extinct Judean palm from a 2,000-year-old excavated seed&#x2015;and Mabey keeps us enthralled from first to last.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jennifer Bort Yacovissi, <em>Washington Independent Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A delightfully accessible work of scholarship.... Mabey&#x2019;s sensitive approach not only succeeds in giving these incredibly vital beings their just place in the story of life. It reminds us that, as we stare in the maw of large-scale environmental change, we can learn the right lessons from our relationship with plants and draw inspiration from their incredible resilience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist, Starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The greatest writer on nature alive....

She did a striptease while playing Bach in Nam June Paik's <i>Sonata for Adults Only</i>. In the 1960s, Moorman (1933&#x2013;1991) became famous for her madcap (and often unclothed) performance antics; less famous but more significant is Moorman's transformative influence on contemporary performance practice&#x2015;and her dedication to the idea that avant-garde art should reach the widest possible audience. In <i>Topless Cellist</i>, the first book to explore Moorman's life and work, Joan Rothfuss rediscovers, and recovers, the legacy of an extraordinary American artist. </p><p>Moorman's arrest in 1967 for performing topless made her a water-cooler conversation-starter, but before her tabloid fame she was a star of the avant-garde performance circuit, with a repertoire of pieces by, among others, Yoko Ono, Joseph Beuys, John Cage, and Paik, her main artistic partner. Moorman invented a new mode of performance that combined classical rigor, jazz improvisation, and avant-garde experiment&#x2015;informed by intuition, daring, and love of spectacle. Moorman's annual festival of the avant-garde offered the public a lively sampler of contemporary art in performance, music, dance, poetry, film, and other media.</p><p>Rothfuss chronicles Moorman's life from her youth in Little Rock, Arkansas (where she was &#x201c;Miss City Beautiful&#x201d; of 1952) through her career in New York's avant-garde to her death from breast cancer in 1991. (Typically, she approached her treatment as if it were a performance.) Deeply researched and profusely illustrated, <i>Topless Cellist</i> offers a fascinating, sometimes heartbreaking, often hilarious story of an artist whose importance was more than the sum of her performances.</p></p><p>Joan Rothfuss is an independent writer and curator based in Minneapolis.<p><i>Topless Cellist</i> is a brilliant portrait of a true original and the chaotic, confrontational, destructive, absurd era in which she lived. It's also a must read for anyone who was flirting with Artland back then, or wishes they'd been on the scene. A portrait of the times as much as the woman, Topless Cellist, gives a full measure of a life lived with 'extreme passion, extreme sex, extreme beauty.'</p>&#x2015;<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i><br><br><p>Ms. Rothfuss has written not just a fine biography of an absorbing character but a necessary one&#x2015;a closely researched tale of a life in art where all was fleetingly possible. The illustrations, needless to add, are exhilarating.</p>&#x2015;<b>Norman Lebrecht</b>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br><p>Essential for art historians, fun for New York City history buffs, inspirational for Lady Gaga fans.</p>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br><p>Fascinating, thorough and insightful, <i>Topless Cellist</i> is the first biography of Moorman to appear, and Rothfuss is careful to position it carefully within the fluid art historical context of its time.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Wire</i><br><br><p>Charlotte Moorman hit the headlines in 1967 when she was arrested for indecent exposure by New York police while playing her cello bare-breasted for a performance of Nam June Paik's 'Opera Sextronique.' But her career amounted to much more than a sensational single run-in with American morality. Born in Arkansas in 1933 and trained at Juilliard, she was a trailblazer in avant-garde performance art. To the composer Edgard Var�se, she was 'the Jeanne d'Arc of new music.' To her native city, Little Rock, she was 'Miss City Beautiful of 1952.' Complex and indomitable, she turned her death from cancer in 1991 into an anarchic event. Joan Rothfuss's level-eyed critical biography captures it all.</p>&#x2015;<b>Holland Cotter</b>, <i>New York Times</i><br><br><p>...with a few exceptions Moorman does not appear in histories of 20th-century music. The vividly written and lavishly illustrated account that is <i>Topless Cellist</i> should go some way to rectify that neglect.</p>&#x2015;<b>John Robert Brown</b>, <i>Classical Music</i><br><br><p>Rothfuss's is an essential volume: not just a record of a remarkable span and its rich artistic milieu, but testament also to the ways Moorman could be so easily written out of the history of the avant-garde.</p>&#x2015;<b>Brian Dillon</b>, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br><p>This impressively researched, engaging and insightful book will hopefully prompt further consideration of Moorman's life, art and legacy.</p>&#x2015;<i>Studies in Theatre and Performance</i><br><br><p>Detailed and thoroughly researched and featuring photographs of the impactful visuals that comprised Moorman's performances, <i>Topless Cellist</i> is unprecedented in its achievement as a biography of this unique artist.</p>&#x2015;<i>Woman's Art Journal</i><br><br><p>... the story of how Moorman, a graduate of the Juilliard School (where her teacher was Leonard Rose) and rank-and-file member of Leopold Stokowski's American Symphony Orchestra, broke ranks with the classical niceties so resolutely is an inspiring one.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Strad</i></p><h2>Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach, Loose-Leaf Version</h2><p>ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH, Eighth Edition, is the perfect text to help you succeed in your abnormal psychology course!

Contrary to popular belief, Edward wanted to reinstate the traditional rules of succession rather than subvert them. He left several detailed versions of his plans for the royal succession, which corrected the mess his father had made of the rules of succession. Edward&#x2019;s plan recognized that the rightful queen was Jane Grey, his Protestant cousin, not his Catholic (and illegitimate) sister, Mary. <p></p> </td> <td> <br> Anon., <i>Jane Grey</i> (c. 1590) [the &#x2018;Houghton Jane&#x2019;] <p></p> Images of Jane Grey have been much contested, but this painting, published for the first time, is her best likeness. Jane Grey, the cousin of Edward VI, was the presumed heir to the throne after his death. Described as &#x201c;very short and thin, but prettily shaped and graceful&#x201d; and &#x201c;a gracious and animated figure&#x201d; by a contemporary, her role in history is difficult to trace since she died at the age of 16 and did not leave much impact on the historical record. However, she was greatly admired for her scholarly achievement. With the backing of John Dudley, earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland, she was proclaimed Queen on July 10, 1553. <p></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br> Hans Eworth, <i>Mary I</i> <p></p> Jane&#x2019;s cousin and the daughter of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, Mary was more than 20 years older than Jane. In 1553, at the age of 37, Mary was short, skinny, and myopic. She was also armored with an absolute conviction about her duty to God, and was prepared to do whatever it took to ascend the throne and return the country to Catholicism. With the help of key supporters and an unexpected turn of events, Mary deposed Jane in a political coup that led Jane to the scaffold. <p></p> </td> <td> <br> Anon., <i>Henry Grey, marquis of Dorset, duke of Suffolk</i> (engraving of lost portrait 1826) <p></p> Henry Grey, Jane&#x2019;s father, married Henry VIII&#x2019;s niece Frances in 1533. Henry ignored him, but he came to favor under Edward. Mary pardoned him for supporting Jane in July 1553, but six months later he joined a conspiracy to stop her marrying Philip II of Spain. Mary panicked and had Jane executed. <p></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p>Lady Jane Grey is the queen England rejected. In July 1553, Edward VI, the heir to Henry VIII, died after only a brief reign as a minor. His death left the Tudor dynasty in turmoil. In the aftermath, Jane Grey was proclaimed queen only to be ousted after thirteen days by Mary Tudor, Henry VIII&#x2019;s bastard daughter. Seven months later she had Jane beheaded. <p>History has portrayed Jane as both a hapless victim of political intrigue and a Protestant martyr, but most of all as an irrelevance, hence the popular but erroneous label, the &#x2018;nine days queen&#x2019;. Revisiting the sources surrounding Jane Grey&#x2019;s upbringing, Eric Ives challenges these views, presenting Jane Grey as an accomplished young woman with a fierce personal integrity, and England&#x2019;s outstanding female scholar. He teases out the complex evidence of the 1553 crisis and dissects the moves and motives of each of the other protagonists: Edward VI himself, feverishly re-writing his will during his dying days; Mary Tudor, the woman who &#x2018;won&#x2019; the crown; John Dudley, Jane&#x2019;s father-in-law, traditionally the villain of the piece; and her father, Henry Grey. As the story moves through the summer of 1553 to Jane&#x2019;s execution, we see these people as agents in Jane Grey&#x2019;s unfolding tragedy and her eventual moral triumph. The result is a new and compelling dissection by a master historian and storyteller of one of history&#x2019;s most shocking injustices.</p></p><h2>Silent Nights: A Collection of Christmas Mysteries (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"Like an assortment of presents under a Christmas tree, there's something for everyone in this Yule-themed reprint anthology in the British Library Crime Classics series from Edwards." &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>Christmas is a mysterious, as well as magical, time of year. Strange things can happen, and this helps to explain the hallowed tradition of telling ghost stories around the fireside as the year draws to a close. Christmas tales of crime and detection have a similar appeal. When television becomes tiresome, and party games pall, the prospect of curling up in the warm with a good mystery is enticing&#x2015;and much better for the digestion than yet another helping of plum pudding.</p><p>Crime writers are just as susceptible as readers to the countless attractions of Christmas. Over the years, many distinguished practitioners of the genre have given one or more of their stories a Yuletide setting. The most memorable Christmas mysteries blend a lively storyline with an atmospheric evocation of the season. Getting the mixture right is much harder than it looks.</p><p><strong>This book introduces of readers to some of the finest Christmas detective stories of the past. Martin Edwards' selection blends festive pieces from much-loved authors with one or two stories which are likely to be unfamiliar even to diehard mystery fans. The result is a collection of crime fiction to savor, whatever the season.</strong></p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F. Keating and Macavity awards for the year's best book about the genre.</p>Like an assortment of presents under a Christmas tree, there's something for everyone in this Yule-themed reprint anthology in the British Library Crime Classics series from Edwards (<i>Guilty Parties</i>). The 15 selections range from stories by such leading lights of the genre's golden age as Arthur Conan Doyle ("The Blue Carbuncle") and Dorothy L. Sayers ("The Necklace of Pearls") to works by such forgotten authors as H.C. Bailey ("The Unknown Murderer") and Ralph Plummer ("Parlour Tricks"). Connoisseurs of locked-room mysteries will welcome Edmund Crispin's "The Name on the Window." Ethel Lina White's "Waxworks" will send shivers down readers' spines, though it contains the now-clich� stopped watch to indicate time of death. In "Stuffing," Edgar Wallace repeats Doyle's prize-in-the-bird trick from "Carbuncle," but this is another quibble. These classic tales of murder and jewel thievery with a light dusting of snow reveal bygone sensibilities, which, by and large, are fun to read about. (<i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i>)<br><br>This book turned out to be such a treasure trove of "lost" Golden Age mysteries, each one of them evocative of the era and the Christmas season. Nice, fairly difficult to solve puzzles and quirky characters abounded. This made for some wonderfully enjoyable reading! (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br>Since I love a good mystery, I was delighted to find this collection of short stories from the Golden Age of British Crime classics. I was pleased to find a few authors in the book that I had heard of in the past and some that are new to me....Martin Edwards did a nice job of choosing what went into the collection and gave a bit of background information about the authors which added to my enjoyment. The stories are short and easy to read, neatly wrapped up and nicely detailed. There is just something special about reading books from the past that I really enjoy. The style is a bit different, and the people seem to always be most courteous--except when they are the criminal of course!...I highly recommend this wonderful collection. (<i><b>Negalley</b></i>)<br><br>An anthology of short mysteries by some of the best authors of the Golden Age of British Crime fiction writing, all set on or around Christmas. Any one who is a fan of the classics will love this. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting authors I have previously read with their stories starring Holmes/Watson &amp; Father Brown among others. I was thrilled to be introduced to authors I haven't read before and will now be looking for more of their work. A great compilation of British Library Crime Classics. (<i>11/03/2015</i>)<br><br>This is a wonderful collection of Golden Age detective stories all set around the festive Christmas season. Martin Edward's Introduction whets the appetite for what's to come and each story is introduced with a useful couple of paragraphs which put the stories in context and give some basic information about each author....Because it's an anthology of different authors you never know what's coming next and the styles are so varied. I really appreciated the opportunity to sample a range of different styles of writing, and try several authors I hadn't come across before. I will certainly be checking out the books of J. Jefferson Farjeon, H. C. Bailey and Leo Bruce. (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br><i>Silent Nights</i> is a collection of short stories written by some of the top mystery writers of the Golden Age. Some of the authors will be familiar to you, others won't. Although they're all set during the Christmas season, there is very little holiday spirit to be found in them, so don't pick this book up expecting to make merry....Most of the mysteries seem to involve some sort of puzzle, and country house settings are found in quite a few. (Of course-- everyone goes to their country house for Christmas, don't they?) Editor Martin Edwards' introduction to the book and his individual introductions to each short story are interesting and informative, so I suggest that you don't skip them. One of the interesting tidbits I learned was that several authors represented in this volume wrote stories Alfred Hitchcock later made into films....Having already read another British Library Crime Classic, <i>Resorting to Murder</i>, I knew what to expect. Many of the authors are no longer well known, but others-- like G.K. Chesterton and Dorothy L. Sayers-- are included here. On the whole I enjoyed <i>Silent Nights</i> more, although the quality of the stories is still a bit uneven. My favorites include Edgar Wallace's "Stuffing," J. Jefferson Farjeon's "The Absconding Treasurer," Sayer's "The Necklace of Pearls," Ethel Lina White's "Waxworks," Marjorie Bowen's "Cambric Tea," and "The Chinese Apple" by Joseph Shearing (nom de plume of Marjorie Bowen). Of these, Farjeon's and White's stories were used by Hitchcock. "A Problem in White" by Nicholas Blake (pseudonym of Cecil Day-Lewis) was unique in the puzzle category. The solution is not included in the story itself, but at the end of the book, giving readers time to mull over the clues and form their own conclusions....If you're a fan of Golden Age mysteries, you're still going to find a new-to-you story or two. If you're a novice like I am, they'll probably all be totally unfamiliar. Since these were written many decades ago when outlooks were quite different, you will run into a racial slur now and again. I chose not to be offended and instead was pleased at how attitudes have changed. I also found it interesting to see how popular crime fiction has changed over time....These British Library Crime Classics being released in the U.S. by Poisoned Pen Press are both entertaining and enlightening, and I recommend them. (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br>A truly fantastic anthology of mysteries to hunker down with on a winter night; Golden Age fans will definitely find a new favorite (I particularly enjoyed "A Problem in White" by Nicholas Blake and " Beef for Christmas" by Leo Bruce) as well as solid entries by old favorites like Dorothy Sayers and Margery Allingham. Every anthology has its dead spots, but this is the rare collection when those stories that jar the reader do so because they are either a bit experimental in style or only tangentially related to the Christmas theme. A great addition to the library of a mystery fan! (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br>Oh be still my little crime fiction heart! What a perfect gift for the coming holidays for those into the "Golden Age of Crime"....Some of the best known authors of that era are showcased in <i>Silent Nights</i> and I loved the linking theme of Christmas... possibly as it's almost that time of year again, who knows? Pretty sure this is indeed the case as I could really see myself curling up with this book in the "lull" between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. It would be keeping with the season as well as feeding my love for a good bit of crime....I'm really loving the anthologies from the "Golden Age of Crime" that Poisoned Pen Press have been releasing, but this one so far has to be my favourite....Would I recommend this book to others? Yes I would. Crime fiction fans into the "Golden Age of Crime" will love <i>Silent Nights</i> as some of the top authors are included with a fine array of Christmas time killings. What more could they want? ;-)...Would I buy this book for myself? Yes I would. I do like a good crime fiction anthology and <i>Silent Nights</i> is indeed a GOOD crime fiction anthology....In summary: Lovers of crime fiction from the late 1800's through to the 1930's and looking for something to read and enjoy during the end of year holidays buy this book. It fits perfectly into the holiday season as well as into your passion for a good old whodunit. (<i><b><i>Janis' Journal Reviews</i></b></i>)<br><br><i>Silent Nights</i> Edited by Martin Edwards, ebook release 2015...Another collection of Christmas Mystery stories, this one from the British Library Crime Classics series. Fifteen tales of murder and thievery at the holidays....I quite enjoyed reading through this collection, even though I didn't love every story in it. It's a nice variation of styles and stories. (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br>Editor Edwards (<i>The Golden Age of Murder</i>) assembles 15 classic Christmas detective stories that include contributions by Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Margery Allingham, and that feature favorite characters Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown, and Lord Peter Wimsey. Interspersed are more obscure but still thoroughly enjoyable golden age mysteries such as Leo Bruce's "Beef for Christmas", starring the inimitable Sergeant Beef, and Ralph Plummer's "Parlour Tricks". VERDICT Follow Edwards's advice to curl up with these good mysteries, as they're much better for the digestion than another helping of plum pudding. A delectable treat for fans of classic crime fiction.

He then traveled to Greece as a correspondent and returned to Cuba to report on the Spanish-American War. At twenty-eight, in failing health, Crane traveled from England to Germany to recuperate the healing atmosphere of The Black Forest.

Charles Taylor argues for a radical redefinition of secularism, and Cornel West defends civil disobedience and emancipatory theology.

He is often called England's national poet, and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time".</p><h2>The Invisible Government</h2><p>1964: by David Wise and Thomas B.

Urick is the most widely used book on underwater acoustics and sonar published today. For more than three decades this book has been the standby of practicing engineers, scientists, technicians, underwater systems managers, teachers and students. Its contents lie squarely in the middle between theory at one end and practical technology at the other. Principles encapsulates the fundamental principles and the various phenomena of underwater sound as they apply to sonar equation, the heart of prediction of sonar performance and the quantitative assessment of effectiveness of a sonar&#39;s target detection capability. Explanations are clear and well written for teaching and self-study and the book has a problem section with solutions. Dr. Robert Urick, the author, was an eminent underwater acoustics scientist and engineer, contributing to nearly all phases of underwater sound research. Among his many awards, Robert Urick received the Distinguished Civilian Service Award from the Navy and The Pioneers Medal from the Acoustical Society of America for his authorship of this book, his many experiments on sound propagation scattering, reverberation and ambient noise, and his grand scholarship and leadership in the field of underwater acoustics.</p><p></p><h2>Teaching Children and Adolescents with Special Needs (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> With collaboration so vital to today's educational arena, this thorough, well-organized, highly readable text concentrates on the general process of teaching&#x2014;the basic &#x201c;how to do it&#x201d;&#x2014;to help prospective teachers of children with mild disabilities in grades K&#x2013;12 learn to work effectively with students, other teachers, and families.&nbsp;<b> </b> Basing coverage on their extensive experience, the authors present practical, research-based teaching strategies that relate to everyday occurrences in schools; provide motivating, experience-based activities; and offer numerous detailed lesson plans.

Sour, sweet, funky, fatty, bright, rich, tangy, bold&#x2014;no wonder adventurous eaters consider Filipino food the next big thing (<i>Vogue</i> declares it &#x201c;the next great American cuisine&#x201d;). Filipinos are the second-largest Asian population in America, and finally, after enjoying Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese food, we&#x2019;re ready to embrace Filipino food, too. Written by trailblazing restaurateurs Nicole Ponseca and Miguel Trinidad, <i>I Am a Filipino</i> is a cookbook of modern Filipino recipes that captures the unexpected and addictive flavors of this vibrant and diverse cuisine.<br><br> The techniques (including braising, boiling, and grilling) are simple, the ingredients are readily available, and the results are extraordinary. There are puckeringly sour adobos with meat so tender you can cut it with a spoon, along with other national dishes like <i>kare-kare</i> (oxtail stew) and <i>kinilaw</i> (fresh seafood dressed in coconut milk and ginger). There are Chinese-influenced <i>pansit</i> (noodle dishes) and <i>lumpia</i> (spring rolls); Arab-inflected cuisine, with its layered spicy curries; and dishes that reflect the tastes and ingredients of the Spaniards, Mexicans, and Americans who came to the Philippines and stayed. Included are beloved fried street snacks like <i>ukoy</i> (fritters), and an array of sweets and treats called <i>meryenda</i>. Filled with suitably bold and bright photographs, <i>I Am a Filipino</i> is like a classic <i>kamayan</i> dinner&#x2014;one long, festive table piled high with food.

With that in mind, Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra offers a radically different answer to this question.<br><br>Malhotra tells an inspiring story about three unique and adventurous mice--Max, Big and Zed--who refuse to accept their reality as given.&nbsp; As we watch their lives unfold and intersect, we discover that instead of just blindly chasing after the cheese, each of us has the ability to escape the maze or even reconfigure it to our liking. <br><br>In the face of established practices, traditional ideas, scarce resources and the powerful demands or expectations of others, we often underestimate our ability to control our own destiny and overcome the constraints we face--or think we face. &nbsp;<i>I Moved Your Cheese</i> reminds us that we <i>can</i> create the new circumstances and realities we want, but first we must discard the often deeply ingrained notion that we are nothing more than mice in someone else's maze. As Zed explains, "You see, Max, the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse."</p><p><b>Deepak Malhotra</b> is a Professor at Harvard Business School, where he teaches Negotiation courses to MBA and Executive students. He has won multiple awards for his teaching, including the MBA Class of 2011 Faculty Award at HBS.&nbsp; Deepak's previous book, <i>Negotiation Genius</i>, won the 2008 Outstanding Book Award from the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution.&nbsp; His work has also received considerable media attention, including multiple appearances by Deepak on CNBC.THE GOOD BOOK<br><br> They called it a revolution. The lesson&#x2014;the insight&#x2014;had spread throughout the maze. Scarcely a mouse remained who had not heard what was contained in the good book.<br><br> The insight was profound. More importantly, it did not rely too much on one&#x2019;s ability to reason. And any mouse will tell you that this attribute is the hallmark of all great truths. So it was accepted as perhaps the greatest, and certainly the most important, truth. And it was all so simple.<br><br> The book made it clear: Change happens. You can sit there and complain about it, or you can change with the times. Do not fear change. Accept change. What happens in the maze is beyond your control. What you can control is your reaction.<br><br> Now, just because every mouse had come to understand this insight does not mean that every one of them was able to adopt it in practice. Some succeeded fully. They learned that change is inevitable and uncontrollable. They accepted that they were helpless to control the workings of the maze&#x2014;fate, they called it&#x2014;and they pledged to adapt.<br><br> Many others succeeded to a lesser degree. They still had moments of fear, immobility, depression, and despair. But such moments were less frequent than in the past. These mice improved their lot in the maze considerably.<br><br> To be sure, there were also mice who rarely thought about what the good book taught them. They agreed with it in principle but did not have the time or energy to change their ways. After all, habits are hard to break. They would work on it later&#x2014;maybe next week, maybe next year.<br><br> Overall, life in the maze was now quite different. In the past, when cheese moved from one location to another, all the mice were in despair. They could not understand what happened. They cursed their luck. They sat and waited in the cheese corner of the past and prayed for its return. They got agitated and lost their temper. They got angry and made an already difficult life even worse.<br><br> Now, after reading the good book, the mice reacted differently. The disappearance of the cheese was still traumatic, and it was still impossible to understand why the cheese had moved. But now the mice began to go in search of new cheese depots. Those who had fully adopted the good book&#x2019;s philosophy were the first to set about in search of the new cheese.<br><br> Those who struggled with the philosophy, who found it difficult to break old habits, were slower to move. But they, too, understood that they had to change with changing times. They, too, eventually went to look for more cheese.<br><br> By learning to change with changing times, the mice succeeded in finding more cheese. They found it more quickly than they had ever done in the past. The good book was right! They had cheese ... more cheese, and sooner than ever before. It does not get much better than that if you are a mouse.<br><br> And so the mice no longer questioned why the cheese moved. Everyone agreed that such questions had no answers. They did not try to devise plans to try to stop the cheese from moving. Only a fool would think that fate could be controlled. Above all, they never again asked the unreasonable question, &#x201c;Who moved my cheese?&#x201d;<br><br> Life was simpler now. It all came down to a very simple equation:<br><br> You want cheese<br> +<br> The cheese is no longer here<br> = Go elsewhere to find the cheese.<br><br> After all, for a mouse in a maze, cheese is really all that matters.<br><br> But then ...<br><br> Well ... then there was Max.<br><br> And Max was altogether different.</p><h2>The Atmosphere: An Introduction to Meteorology</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Using everyday, easy-to-grasp examples to reinforce basic concepts, this highly regarded handbook remains the standard introduction to meteorology and the atmosphere &#x2013; components, problems, and applications. <b> </b> Includes the most up-to-date coverage of topics such as: ozone depletion; the ultraviolet index; temperature; dew point temperature and orographic effects; wildfires and weather; thunderstorms and lightning; the record-breaking Florida hurricane season; effects of air pollution, and more.

Much has been written about Warren Buffett and his investment philosophy; little has been made public about the inside management of Berkshire Hathaway. With a market cap exceeding 100 billion , Berkshire Hathaway has a market value surpassing many icons of American business such as Dell, AT&amp;T, Disney, Ford, Gillette, American Express, and GM. Drawing on his personal experiences as well as those of Berkshire's chief executives, officers, and directors interviewed for this book, Berkshire insider Robert P. Miles provides a unique look at the Berkshire Hathaway culture and its management principles.</p></p><p>The success of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., is legendary. Yet to understand this success, you must go below the surface to see how the hands-off management style of Berkshire Hathaway allows its acquisitions to grow exponentially. The Warren Buffett CEO provides a rare up-close and personal view of nearly twenty operating managers within Berkshire Hathaway-owned companies.<br> <br> Through interviews with key executives from these companies, Berkshire Hathaway expert Robert Miles offers a fascinating look at how the CEOs of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries are managed. Along with candid revelations about their relationships with "the best boss in the world"-these executives shed light on who Buffett might choose to succeed him and how the management structure of Berkshire Hathaway will change once he is gone.<br> <br> The Warren Buffett CEO begins with the foundation of this powerhouse holding company-the insurers. Ajit Jain shares his experiences as head of the fifteen-member team that is Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and talks about the management knowledge he has gleaned from Buffett. The two presidents and CEOs of GEICO, Tony Nicely and Lou Simpson, explain how they manage 18,000 employees and the GEICO $2.5 billion equity portfolio, with no interference from Berkshire Hathaway, while setting a management model that will likely be followed after Buffett retires-one CEO manages operations, the other CEO manages investments.<br> <br> This comprehensive book is as diverse as the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway. The Warren Buffett CEO includes rare interviews with Berkshire Hathaway CEOs . . .<br> * Al Ueltschi, founder and CEO of FlightSafety International<br> * Stan Lipsey, publisher and CEO of the Buffalo News<br> * Chuck Huggins, CEO of See's Candies, Inc.<br> * Richard Santulli, CEO of ExecutiveJet<br> <br> . . . that reveal the secrets of Berkshire Hathaway management: a passion for the business-not the money-and a philosophy of succeeding without compromising your principles.<br> <br> The Warren Buffett CEO explores the history of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries and how the different styles of their managers mesh with Buffett's. Miles follows the entire acquisition process and details the excitement of CEOs who see Berkshire Hathaway as being beneficial from both a financial and managerial standpoint. Examples such as Nebraska Furniture Mart, H.H. Brown Shoe Co., Scott Fetzer Companies, and Helzberg Diamonds illustrate how each Berkshire Hathaway company has the characteristics of a classic Buffett investment and how Buffett prefers a wholly owned company with a management team already in place.<br> <br> To better understand his investment approach, Buffett himself has said, you should look at his operating managers and companies. The Warren Buffett CEO does this and much more. By examining the top CEOs within Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, you'll understand how these executives succeed inside Berkshire Hathaway and how, year after year, they produce unparalleled profits under Warren Buffett's guidance." Everyone knows Warren is the greatest investor of our time. . . .This book for the first time captures his genius as a manager." --Jack Welch<br> <br> "Robert Miles clearly understands the company well." --Warren Buffett<br> <br> Much has been written about Warren Buffett and the philosophy that made him the most successful investor in history, yet nothing-until now-has been written about his role as manager of the diverse companies under Berkshire Hathaway's ownership.<br> <br> Berkshire Hathaway expert Robert Miles explores the hands-off management style that has proven successful for both Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. Including rare interviews with executives who run the companies within Berkshire Hathaway holdings, The Warren Buffett CEO provides a unique insider's perspective from managers such as:<br> * Lou Simpson and Tony Nicely, Presidents and CEOs of Capital Operations and Operations, respectively, Geico<br> * Ajit Jain, President, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group<br> * Richard Santulli, President and CEO, ExecutiveJet<br> <br> Besides revealing the successful management style of the powerhouse holding company known as Berkshire Hathaway, The Warren Buffett CEO sheds light on the company's future as well as on who will succeed the "Oracle of Omaha" when he steps down. You may never get to work with Warren Buffett, but in reading The Warren Buffett CEO you will understand what it is like to work for "the best boss in the world."<br> <br> With a foreword by Tom Osborne, US Congressman and Former University of Nebraska Head Football Coach</p><h2>Music in Egypt: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture Includes CD (Global Music Series)</h2><p><em>Music in Egypt</em> is one of several case-study volumes that can be used along with <em>Thinking Musically</em>, the core book in the <strong>Global Music Series.</strong> <em>Thinking Musically</em> incorporates music from many diverse cultures and establishes the framework for exploring the practice of music around the world. It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the Global Music Series. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study.<br> <em>Music in Egypt</em> provides an overview of the country's rich and dynamic contemporary musical landscape. It offers an in-depth look at specific Egyptian musical traditions, paying special attention to performers and the variety of contexts in which performances occur. The book acknowledges the pervasive presence of Islam by focusing on two Muslim performance genres and by considering the age-old issue of the compatibility of music and Islam. It accomplishes the latter by incorporating the voices of many of the performers featured on the accompanying CD. The volume features a variety of musics that reflect and help to create a number of distinct regional, national, and community identities co-existing in Egypt today.<br> Drawing on more than twenty years of extensive fieldwork, Scott L. Marcus offers detailed ethnographic documentation of seven performance traditions found in Egypt today: the call to prayer; <em>madh</em>, a genre of Sufi religious music; southern Egyptian <em>mizmar</em> folk music; early twentieth-century <em>takht</em>-based art music; music by the acclaimed singer Umm Kulthum, which dominated the mid-twentieth century; wedding procession music; and music by the current superstar pop singer Hakim. The book is packaged with an 80-minute audio CD containing excellent examples of each tradition. All of the examples are based in a single melodic mode--maqam rast--to best engage students with the musical form, structure, and practice of the traditions. Separate educational tracks on the CD introduce <em>maqam rast</em> and the variety of rhythms found in the CD examples. In addition, the CD features a special solo improvisation (<em>taqasim</em>) in <em>maqam rast</em> by UCLA professor Ali Jihad Racy, to help students better understand this particular melodic mode.<br> Enhanced by eyewitness accounts of performances, interviews with performers, listening examples, and song lyrics that enable students to interact with the text, <em>Music in Egypt</em> provides a unique and hands-on introduction to the country's diverse and captivating music.<br></p><p>Scott L.

The brain is physical. If the mind is physical, we cannot see how. If we cannot see how the mind is physical, we cannot see how it can interact with the body. And if the mind is not physical, it cannot interact with the body. Or so it seems.</p><p>In this book the philosopher Jonathan Westphal examines the mind-body problem in detail, laying out the reasoning behind the solutions that have been offered in the past and presenting his own proposal. The sharp focus on the mind-body problem, a problem that is not about the self, or consciousness, or the soul, or anything other than the mind and the body, helps clarify both problem and solutions.</p><p>Westphal outlines the history of the mind-body problem, beginning with Descartes. He describes mind-body dualism, which claims that the mind and the body are two different and separate things, nonphysical and physical, and he also examines physicalist theories of mind; antimaterialism, which proposes limits to physicalism and introduces the idea of qualia; and scientific theories of consciousness.</p><p>Finally, Westphal examines the largely forgotten neutral monist theories of mind and body, held by Ernst Mach, William James, and Bertrand Russell, which attempt neither to extract mind from matter nor to dissolve matter into mind. Westphal proposes his own version of neutral monism. This version is unique among neutral monist theories in offering an account of mind-body interaction.</p></p><p>Jonathan Westphal is a Permanent Member of the Senior Common Room at University College, Oxford.

Miro studied art in his native Barcelona before joining the Paris art scene in the 1920s. Fantasy, dreams, and myths played an important role in Miro&#39;s early works, many of which are included in the more than 70 full-color reproductions of paintings, sculptures, and tapestries in this collection.

This highly effective eating plan is presented in a compassionate voice by two experienced health coaches who share personal experiences of battling weight and emotional eating issues. Whereas most diets are short-lived or require substantial upkeep to maintain, <i>Eat, Live, Thrive Diet </i>is a viable eating plan that women can adhere to indefinitely. In addition to minimizing sugar intake, the plan emphasizes the importance of short-term intermittent fasting--a simple lifestyle change that makes it easier and more effective for many mature women to reach their health and weight loss goals. The book also highlights health risks and drawbacks of many popular fad diets that can be harmful on a long-term basis.</p><p>DANNA DEMETRE, RN, is an author, speaker, and cofounder of Lean Healthy Ageless. She has been a guest on a variety of national and local shows to include, <i>Fox News Dallas</i>, <i>The 700 Club</i>, <i>ABC News N</i>OW, and Moody Broadcasting's award winning <i>Midday Connection</i>. Danna, who is in her sixties, lives with her husband in the foothills outside San Diego. ROBYN THOMSON, an advance clinical weight loss practitioner, has worked with cutting edge nutritional companies and received training from some of the top doctors and scientists in the industry. Through seminars, workshops, and coaching, she helps people lose weight, improve their nutrition, and get more active. She is in her fifties and lives near the beach in San Diego with her husband, Rob.<p><b>Chapter 1<br><br>Yes, You Can Eat, Live, and Thrive!<br></b></p><p>We are all so different. If Danna burns more calories than she eats, she sheds fat and her weight goes down. Not so for Robyn. Like many (perhaps most) women over forty-five, she is highly sensitive to grains. But unlike many women, Robyn is not insulin resistant, so she can eat a normal amount of carbohydrates and still lose weight. She just can&#x2019;t include many grains or legumes because her body hates them and revolts by triggering digestive symptoms, water retention, mental fogginess, and weight gain.</p><p>In contrast to both of us, our friend Janice can barely look at a starchy carbohydrate without gaining weight. She is highly insulin resistant. More on that to come, but it means that her muscle cells don&#x2019;t allow insulin to transport carbohydrates (converted into glucose) to be stored (as glycogen) for future energy. Because survival requires that glucose not accumulate in the blood, it gets diverted to Janice&#x2019;s fat cells, which happily convert it to more fat. Even when she eats what she considers normal amounts of grains and other starches, such as potatoes, Janice gains weight.</p><p>Counting calories does not work for Janice. Fortunately, the Eat, Live, Thrive Diet does.</p><p>Like the three of us, you are unique. So, what are your dietary stumbling blocks? Those can be difficult to figure out on your own. The ELT Diet can help you discover the foods holding you back from reaching your goals.</p><p><br><b>The Reality of Weight Gain After Forty-Five</b></p><p>Women over forty-five are often faced with these issues when it comes to weight loss:</p><p>~&nbsp; a lower carbohydrate threshold, which declines steadily with age</p><p>~&nbsp; insulin resistance, which increases over time and promotes diabetes</p><p>~&nbsp; unknown food sensitivities</p><p>~&nbsp; hormonal imbalance</p><p>~&nbsp; slower metabolism due to muscle atrophy</p><p>After the age of thirty, as women, we lose the ability to utilize and burn carbohydrates as well as we did when we were younger. The decline is slow and insidious and can go unnoticed into our forties and perhaps fifties, but it is happening. Foods that we once could eat are now causing undue inflammation in our bodies and disrupting our digestion, joint health, and metabolism.</p><p><i>God has provided us with a sophisticated healing system. Focus on the building blocks of what he has provided, such as sound nutrition, exercise, sleep, attitude, and prayer.</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;Dr. Mark Stengler, ND</i></p><p>All the while, as we are edging toward menopause&#x2014;or in the midst of it or past it&#x2014;our hormones are being greatly influenced by many of the grains and processed foods we eat, making it more difficult to maintain any level of hormone balance even if we are using the latest and greatest bioidentical hormones and supplements.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the reality. What can we do about it?<br><br></p><p><b>The ABCs of the ELT Diet</b></p><p>If you want to be lean and healthy, look younger than the years on your birth certificate, and have energy to embrace life fully, you must nourish your body with real food. Our diet plan will help you not only burn fat and drop pounds but also rev up your energy. It also provides a nutritional foundation to slow down and perhaps even reverse some of the aging process.</p><p>Our ELT Diet and Lifestyle Plan is designed to:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; Activate your metabolism and promote steady weight loss</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; Balance your blood sugar and cravings</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;~ Cleanse your body of toxins and decrease inflammation</p><p>Our eating plan is especially effective for mature (ageless!) women who&#x2019;ve experienced continued difficulty losing weight on portion or calorie-controlled diets. It is strategically designed to promote a robust metabolism, which enhances fat-burning capability no matter one&#x2019;s age. Our participants are amazed at how much they can eat on our diet and still get excellent and steady results.</p><p><br><b>Step-by-Step Guidance</b></p><p>In the ELT Diet and Lifestyle Plan, we will guide you through three progressive phases, culminating in a realistic and enjoyable lifestyle eating plan that will serve you well for the rest of your life.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll show you how to use the first two phases to reboot your lifestyle when you veer a bit off track. (Let&#x2019;s be honest&#x2014;who doesn&#x2019;t? Our strategies help you address that reality so you can keep moving forward.)</p><p>We will teach you how to make your body shift from being predominantly a carbohydrate or sugar burner to a metabolically agile burner of all fuels, including fat.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll introduce you to the power of intermittent fasting and all its benefits and our kinder and gentler version called the Eat, Live, Thrive Eating Cycle. While short-term fasting is optional, we know from our own personal experiences and from the testimonies of many of our clients that it can be a game changer. And the benefits go far beyond weight loss to include brain health, higher energy, and disease prevention.</p><p>And just as important, we&#x2019;ll teach you how to design a lasting lifestyle eating plan that will be your foundation for life. Yes, there&#x2019;s room for a few empty calories. No, you won&#x2019;t follow your ideal plan perfectly every day. But you will discover the best plan for you and know that if you practice it moderately well most days, your body will reward you with great results!</p><p>Although our diet was designed specifically for women, it works great for men as well. We&#x2019;ve been pleased to learn that many husbands and boyfriends are so impressed with their wives&#x2019; and girlfriends&#x2019; weight loss and health improvement that they decided to participate with them on the diet. They love the recipes and healthy substitutions we recommend to replace the foods that are troublesome. But beware: men lose weight faster than women, so don&#x2019;t let that discourage you!</p><p><br><b>Figuring Out Good and Bad Foods</b></p><p>After years of coaching women, we have seen the greatest breakthroughs when specific troublesome foods are eliminated for a period of time and then reintroduced strategically based on the body&#x2019;s response. Most women have no idea that they have sensitivity to certain foods because they&#x2019;ve not identified a direct correlation between the food and its negative effect on their bodies.</p><p>It has been documented that more than 20 percent of people in industrialized countries have food intolerances that disrupt their health and contribute to weight-loss challenges. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 65 percent of adults have some level of lactose intolerance as well. It is impossible to know how many undocumented sensitivities exist considering the steadily increasing number of individuals struggling with leaky gut and other digestive issues. And quite frankly, most of us are simply consuming too many processed foods and realizing the effects of all the additives and preservatives.</p><p>Some women don&#x2019;t remember what it&#x2019;s like to feel great. They have no clue that removing certain foods and adding others can help them look and feel years younger. Just imagine turning back your biological clock by simply eating the right foods for you. It is not only possible but also relatively easy to discover how to do just that using the personalized approach we teach in this book.</p><p><br><b>An Almost-New Body Every Eight Years</b></p><p>God designed our bodies with perfect blueprints that tell them what to do with the fuel we give them. They know how to build new blood cells, skin, muscle, bone, and so on. In fact, our bodies are constantly regenerating. We slough off dead skin cells hourly and replace them with new ones. We regenerate red blood cells within 120 days. We even build an entirely new skeletal system over time.</p><p>Unbelievably, the majority of living cells in your body today will not be present in your body eight years from today!</p><p>Just as you cannot build a brick house out of straw, you cannot build a healthy body out of chocolate chip cookies and potato chips. The quality of the skin, bones, muscles, and cells of your body depend on the quality of the building materials you choose to supply, meal after meal! You truly are (and will be) what you eat.</p><p>We hope that fact motivates you to see each food you put in your body for what it is and choose wisely based on what you learn as you experience the ELT Diet.</p><p><br><b>Beyond Gluten Sensitivity</b></p><p>Many have jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon, and for good reason. It is estimated that much of the Western world is showing signs of being highly sensitive to an overabundance of processed wheat products. These include commercially made breads, pastas, crackers, packaged sauces, salad dressings, and, of course, desserts.</p><p>Many of the most well-respected health experts believe there are no significant nutritional benefits found in commercially made products and that everyone would be better served by removing these products from their diets. Patti Milligan, the ELT Diet&#x2019;s functional nutrition advisor and a registered dietician with a master&#x2019;s degree in nutritional biochemistry and exercise science, agrees. She believes that the quality of mainstream wheat products in the US is troublesome for everyone&#x2014;not just those with actual sensitivity to wheat&#x2014;because conventional wheat is washed in chlorine. Additionally, many packaged wheat products use additives and preservatives that wreak havoc on our bodies.</p><p>Unfortunately, the solution is not just to go gluten free. Many people make the shift and end up eating excessive amounts of corn- or rice-based products, which also creates a high carbohydrate load and other challenges for their bodies. Additionally, food sensitivities go far beyond gluten. Many of our clients are flabbergasted to realize that some of the &#x201c;healthful&#x201d; foods they&#x2019;ve been eating are problems for them.</p><p>Even when true sensitivity is not an issue, sugar addiction, carbohydrate overload, and toxic buildup (from all the commercially processed foods) can send our bodies on a downward health spiral. The strategic elimination of food culprits and plans to test each to determine our reactions are key factors in discovering the ideal diet suited to our bodies.</p><p><i>In the Western world, we eat the quantity of carbohydrates as if we&#x2019;re training for a marathon, but we never run the marathon!</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;Patti Milligan</i></p><p>Therefore, if you have cut calories and still not lost weight, reduced all fat and gotten fatter, exercised your tail off and the fat hasn&#x2019;t budged, watched the fat around your middle increase over the past decade, gained and lost and gained and lost, then it&#x2019;s time to turn your attention to the type and quality of foods you eat regularly. Also, it is very likely you&#x2019;re exceeding your carbohydrate threshold and converting those calories quickly to stored fat.</p><p><br><b>Insulin Resistance and Beyond</b></p><p>Excessive carbohydrate intake and insufficient carbohydrate metabolism (in other words, insulin resistance) is at the root of many women&#x2019;s weight issues. Patti Milligan believes the average woman consumes about 300 to 350 grams of total carbohydrate per day. That amounts to almost 1,400 calories in carbohydrates alone, which is about 82 percent of a woman&#x2019;s total caloric needs for one day.</p><p>Insulin resistance (IR), also known as metabolic syndrome, can range from minimal to extreme. It is a progressive disease if not treated with proper diet modifications. It has become synonymous with prediabetes. IR puts you at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and it triples your risk for heart disease. Losing weight becomes almost impossible unless you change your diet consistently.</p><p>An individual is considered to have insulin resistance (IR) if he or she has three or more of the following markers:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; blood pressure &#x2265; 130/85 mm Hg or use of medication for hypertension</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; fasting glucose &#x2265; 100 mg/dL or use of medication for high blood glucose</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; HDL cholesterol &#x2264; 50 mg/dL</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; triglycerides &#x2265; 150 mg/dL</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp; waist circumference &#x2265; 35 inches</p><p>Your body must maintain a very narrow blood-sugar (glucose) range at all times. Blood-sugar spikes occur when you consume more carbohydrates than necessary to meet immediate energy requirements. When this happens, the excess glucose produced must be promptly transported and stored elsewhere. That is the job of insulin. It converts that excess into either glycogen (an energy source stored in the muscles or liver) or fat. Fat becomes the primary storage if glycogen stores are full and/or you are insulin resistant.</p><p>IR is caused when muscle, liver, and fat cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Research reveals that this problem increases as we age and is closely related to lifestyle habits. The most important of these habits is the quality of our nutrition. That means we can have control over this ever-increasing metabolic syndrome by changing our diets.</p><p>At least 50 percent of Americans have some form of insulin resistance, according to Dr. Robert Lustig, professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. That percentage is even higher in adults older than forty-five. &#x201c;In contrast to popular false beliefs, weight loss and health should not be a constant battle uphill through calorie restriction, which simply doesn&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; says Dr. Andreas Eenfeldt in an article on his blog. He then goes on to quote Dr. Lustig:</p><p><i>Following current dietary advice is counterintuitive to achieving a healthy weight.</i></p><p>The reason is the myth of energy balance. If you believe this, then you believe that obesity is a physics problem; too much energy in, too little energy out. Energy balance assumes that all calories are equal, no matter where they come from. Rather, obesity is about energy deposition into fat tissue. Obesity is a biochemistry problem, and where those nutrients came from determine where they go in the body. It&#x2019;s called nutritional biochemistry and it shows that all calories are not created equal.</p><p>Even for women who are not truly insulin resistant, excessive carbohydrates can create a roller-coaster effect as blood sugar levels peak and then fall throughout the day. Thus, cravings increase, energy decreases, and immunity declines.</p><p>Milligan also alerts us to the important role that a sedentary lifestyle plays in insulin resistance. Just increasing movement to three ten-minute spurts of intentional activity within your day can improve the sensitivity of insulin to your cells significantly because it stokes your metabolic furnace. In chapter 12, we&#x2019;ll share the importance of leading an active lifestyle and tips to easily improve your fitness.</p><p>Now let&#x2019;s take a look at an overview of the three key phases of the ELT Diet and Lifestyle Plan.</p></p><h2>Sermons: Biblical Wisdom for Daily Living</h2><p>The Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes is widely acclaimed as one of America's greatest preachers and most influential thinkers. For a quarter century at Harvard, Gomes's legendary sermons have mesmerized congregations. Humor and wit -- he quotes from T. S. Eliot and Woody Allen as well as from the Bible -- inform the serious moral content of his sermons, and have made him a sought-after speaker at Harvard and international events, including two presidential inaugurations.<p>Now, following his groundbreaking work, <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Good Book,</em> comes <em>Sermons,</em> a collection of forty timely addresses to guide us through the year. Starting with Advent and built around the Christian calendar, these are timeless distillations of Gomes's favorite sermons. With his characteristic eloquence and in an engaging and stimulating manner, he offers readers the tools they need to understand the Bible and the joy and inspiration it can bring to everyday life.</p></p><p>Reading a book of sermons should not have the same impact as hearing them preached from the pulpit. After all, listening to the mellifluous tones of a preacher speaking heartfelt words is an irreplaceable experience. But reading sermons provides a <i>different</i> experience, one that can be just as powerful. As Peter J. Gomes, author of <i>The Good Book</i> points out in his inspiring collection simply entitled <i>Sermons</i>, by looking at the discourses, the reader is able to form a special connection with the words and the preacher who offers them by taking control of the text. The reader may stop to refer to the Bible or pause at length to ponder how the words relate to him or her. However, this caveat Gomes offers on the differences between written and spoken sermons is ultimately unnecessary. These texts, transcribed straight from Gomes's preachings, have an oral quality to them that allows the reader to "hear" the words as Gomes "speaks" them, giving his ideas that much more force.<p> In his introduction, Henry Louis Gates Jr. describes Gomes as "a cross between Cotton Mather and Martin Luther King Jr. [Gomes], clearly, was a man of words, but a man of words with a difference." The Harvard preacher gives us no less--words that make a difference--in his compilation of 40 sermons, each built upon the Christian calendar, taking us from Advent to Christmas. (The number is no accident, 40 being an important biblical number: the great flood lasted for 40 days, the children of Israel wandered for 40 years; Jesus fasted for 40 days. ) The range of sermons--from "The Art of Impatient Living" to "Growing Up" to "Acts of Reconciliation"--offer biblical wisdom in a modern context, using current references such as Donald Trump, artist George Segal, and Julia Child.

Porter, curator emeritus, Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Howard University<br></strong></p></p><p><i>We Are Your Sisters</i>, a collection of letters, oral histories, and excerpts from diaries and autobiographies, is "a documentary portrayal of black women who lived between 1800 and the 1880s." As such, <i>We Are Your Sisters</i> provides a panoramic portrait of black women's lives, presenting the words of laundresses and maids, of writers and teachers. You'll find the testimonies of slave women, as collected in the 1920s and '30s by the Federal Writers Project, on such matters as work, courtship, and family life; letters from slave women that include moving appeals for husbands to save them from slave traders; and first-person accounts of women's resistance to slavery. There are also letters from women such as Rosetta Douglass Sprague, the daughter of Frederick Douglass; accounts of the doings of upper-class blacks in the years following the Civil War; and excerpts from the diary of Frances Rollin, author of a biography of black activist and Civil War soldier Martin Delany.Dorothy Sterling is a native New Yorker now living on Cape Cod in Wellfleet. She has made many trips to Nantucket, Block Island, Martha&#39;s Vineyard, and Long Island. She is a painstaking and thorough researcher with a long list of natural history, biography, and fiction books to her credit.</p><h2>Under The Perfect Sun: The San Diego Tourists Never See</h2><p>A history of class and power in San Diego, an anti-tourist guide that debunks the sunshine myth for locals and visitors alike. <i>Let's just say there was good liaison between city government and business.</i>Ex-mayor of San Diego, Frank Curran, on the 1960s For fourteen million tourists each year, San Diego is the fun place in the sun that never breaks your heart. But America's eighth largest city has a dark side. Behind Sea World, the Zoo, the Gaslamp District, and the beaches of La Jolla hides a militarized metropolis, boasting the West Coast's most stratified economy and a tumultuous history of municipal corruption, virulent anti-unionism, political repression, and racial injustice. Though its boosters tirelessly propagate an image of a carefree beach town, the real San Diego shares dreams and nightmares with its violent twin, Tijuana. This alternative civic history deconstructs the mythology of "America's finest city," exposing its true undergirdings of militarism, racism and economic inequality. Acclaimed urban theorist Mike Davis documents the secret history of the domineering elites who have turned a weak city government into a powerful machine for private wealth. Jim Miller tells the story from the other side: chronicling the history of protest in San Diego from the Wobblies to today's "Globalphobics." Kelly Mayhew, meanwhile, presents the voices of paradise's forgotten working people and new immigrants. The texts are vividly enhanced by Fred Londonier's photographs.</p><p><b>Jim Miller</b> is a professor of English at San Diego City College. <b>Kelly Mayhew</b> is a professor of English, philosophy and humanities at San Diego City College.San Diego is the latest Sunbelt metropolis to come under the scrutiny of historian Davis (City of Quartz) in this damning trio of essays on "America's Finest City." As in The Grit Beneath the Glitter, the collection on Las Vegas he co-edited in 2002, Davis teams up here with local critics to penetrate the shiny surface of a city that has always seemed to resist the idea of historical depth. Together they present "an alternative, peoples' history of San Diego (from the dual perspectives of its elites and their opponents) as well as autobiographical portraits of some of the `other' San Diego's everyday heroes." While those who believe that Davis has become the very embodiment of the noir sensibility he once scrupulously dissected may chafe at the book's tabloid-like promises to uncover the city's "real" or "true" history, they will nevertheless find his chapter on San Diego's multigenerational plutocracy engrossing. Davis is meticulous in showing how a succession of robber barons, from the early 20th century to the present, have used their control over city politics (and politicians) to turn San Diego into one of the most unregulated, militarized and segregated regions in the country. Co-authors Miller and Mayhew are no less diligent in their efforts to document the struggles of San Diego's embattled workers, unions and ethnic minorities. Miller's recovery of the city's radical past offers a powerful counter-image of a town virtually synonymous with the Navy and the G.O.P. And in what surely is the most accessible piece in the book, Mayhew gathers the first-person narratives of current immigrants and activists. Some readers will no doubt be put off by the book's admittedly partisan outlook and at times strident rhetoric; however, the sense of urgency will certainly appeal to anyone concerned about the rate at which private wealth determines public policy in America. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Norton Introduction to the Short Novel</h2><p><p><strong>The fifteen works collected in <em>The Norton Introduction to the Short Novel</em>, Third Edition, represent a wide range of periods and international voices.</strong></p> Designed with the undergraduate in mind, the anthology includes a helpful introduction by Professor Beaty that defines the short novel in contrast to the short story and the longer novel and explores the formal and thematic corollaries of this particular literary form.&nbsp; Additionally, a short biographical headnote precedes each selection to prepare the reader to experience, appreciate, and understand the works as fully as possible during a first reading.

In January 1919, after being arrested for her involvement in a workers' uprising in Berlin, she was brutally murdered by a group of right-wing soldiers. Her body was recovered days later from a canal. Six years earlier she had published what was undoubtedly her finest achievement, <em>The Accumulation of Capital</em> - a book which remains one of the masterpieces of socialist literature. Taking Marx as her starting point, she offers an independent and fiercely critical explanation of the economic and political consequences of capitalism in the context of the turbulent times in which she lived, reinterpreting events in the United States, Europe, China, Russia and the British Empire. Many today believe there is no alternative to global capitalism. This book is a timely and forceful statement of an opposing view.</p><p><p><strong>Rosa Luxemburg</strong> (1870-1919).

Presents the statistics of how many pilots will die in the zone within a year; calls attention to the eight top pilot killers (such as &#34;VFR into IFR,&#34; &#34;Takeoff and Climb&#34;); and maps strategies for avoiding, diverting, correcting, and managing the dangers. Includes a Pilot Personality Self-Assessment Exercise that identifies pilot &#34;types&#34; and how each type can best react to survive the killing zone.</p><p>You can fly through the zone. Or you can die in it. Most pilots earn their private certificate with 40 to 70 flight hours. Then they leave their instructors behind and enter the killing zone. Grimly embracing the period from 50 to 350 flight hours--a vital time for new pilots to build practical and decision-making skills--this deadly zone lays in wait for those who err, killing more pilots than all other periods put together. You don't have to be one of them. Aviation safety specialist Paul Craig--discoverer of the killing zone--shows you the fatal errors that inexperienced pilots make time after time and gives you tactics to avoid them. Based on the first in-depth, scientific study of pilot behavior and general aviation flying accidents in more than 20 years, The Killing Zone:<p>*Identifies the time frame in which you are most likely to die</p><p>*Alerts you to the 12 mistakes most likely to kill you</p><p>*Outlines preventive strategies for flying through the zone alive</p><p>*Provides guidelines for avoiding, evading, diverting, correcting, and managing dangers</p><p>*Includes a "Pilot Personality Self-Assessment Exercise" for an individualized survival strategy</p><p>Survive the dangers that lurk in the killing zone.</p>Paul A. Craig, Ed.D., longtime pilot, FAA award-winning flight instructor, and aviation educator and author, designed and conducted the research described in this book based on his lifelong concern with the high accident rate among general aviation pilots, and in the process of earning his doctorate in education, with special empahsis on pilot decision-making and flight training.

Drawing on almost thirty years of scholarship, prominent Yiddish scholar Dovid Katz traces the origins of Yiddish back to the Europe of a thousand years ago, and shows how those origins are themselves an uninterrupted continuation of the previous three millennia of Jewish history and culture in the Near East. <i>Words on Fire</i> narrates the history of the language from medieval times onward, through its development as written literature, particularly for and by Jewish women. In the wake of secularizing and modernizing movements of the nineteenth century, Yiddish rose spectacularly in a few short years from a mass folk idiom to the language of sophisticated modern literature, theater, and journalism. Although a secular Yiddish culture no longer exists, Katz argues that its resurgence among religious Jewish communities ensures that Yiddish will still be a thriving language in the twenty-first century. For anyone interested in Jewish history and tradition, <i>Words on Fire</i> will be a definitive account of this remarkable language and the culture that created and sustained it.</p><p>"Dovid Katz's book on Yiddish reflects the beauty, the variety, and the warmth of a language that refuses to be extinguished. Its miraculous survival brings joy to its readers." (Elie Wiesel) <p> "<i>Words On Fire</i> is not only a great history, it's a great read. Dovid Katz writes with the precision of a scholar, and the heart of a poet." (Jonathan Safran Foer, author of <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i>) </p><p> "This is a book whose time has come. Dovid Katz presents the complex and international origins of Yiddish over a thousand years in a delightfully readable narrative that belies the enormous scholarship in many languages that underlies his work." (Ruth Gay, author of <i>The Jews of Germany: A Historical Portrait and Unfinished People: Eastern European Jews Encounter America</i>) </p><p> "I love this book. It's a treasure trove of nostalgia and a beacon of hope. It warmed my heart to read how the rich emotional Yiddish jargon became an elegant language of literature; then it broke my heart to read about the near-total destruction of Yiddish civilization, one of the great cultures of the world. This book revives hope that Yiddish will still flourish, even in a small way." (Alan Dershowitz) </p><p> "In <i>Words on Fire</i>, Professor Dovid Katz reaffirms his role as one of the world's leading scholars in the field of Yiddish Studies. Katz's command of Yiddish linguistics, Yiddish literature and Eastern European Jewish cultural history is unsurpassed. <i>Words on Fire</i> is a bold and timely book that deserves to be read not only by specialists in the field of Jewish Studies but also by anyone concerned about the future of Yiddish and Jewish culture." (Carl J. Rheins, Ph.D., Executive Director, YIVO Institute for Jewish Research) </p><p> "This amazing book is as provocative as it is profound. Written with verve and passion, it goes far beyond recycling accepted 'truths' about the Yiddish language, European Jewish civilization, and modern Jewish cultural politics. Its bold new conceptualization of the still evolving saga of Yiddish is a product of decades of inspired research, inspiring teaching and penetrating thinking of one of the most brilliant Yiddish scholars of my generation. It will stimulate further debate among scholars and laymen who are concerned with the ethos, history, and significance of Yiddish, the Ashkenazic cultural heritage, and Jewish identity in our contemporary post-modern world." (Dov-Ber Kerler, Professor of Yiddish Studies, Indiana University at Bloomington) </p><p> "In a field in which ingrained myth is regularly served up as truth, and amateurs pose as experts, this accessible history of Yiddish, written by a native speaker who is also a scholar of historical linguistics, systematically clears the debris in order to set the record straight about the past, the present, and even to offer some reasonable speculations about the future of Yiddish."

A companion book to&nbsp;<i>The Law of Light</i>&nbsp;but can be read on its own.<br><br>Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1946, there was little known about The Essenes; a brotherhood of holy men and women living together within a community over two thousand years ago. The Essenes considered themselves to be a separate people--not because of external signs like skin colour, hair colour, but because of the illumination of their inner life and their knowledge of the hidden mysteries of nature unknown to other men. <i><br><br>The Gate of Light&nbsp;</i>is based on Lars Muhl&#x2019;s lifelong search for God, it doesn&#x2019;t claim any absolute truths but sets out to provide a practice based on Essene teachings that allows us to look at how we judge ourselves and how we live in the world. He asks: What motivates us? How do we create a balance between thoughts, words and actions? How do we align ourselves in relation to our higher self and become the universal light beings we are meant to be? The Essenes understood that everything is interactively connected and that everything is energy. For them, God was the name for the highest form of awareness, something omnipresent and, if a human wished to learn how then they could communicate with this ever present energy and through this communication humans could realize their full potential. Drawing on this ancient knowledge Lars presents a complete practice to help us recognize and answer the above questions. He particularly looks at: Grief and Happiness, Balance and Awareness, Selflessness, Boredom and Renunciation, Loneliness, Gratitude, Silence and Thoughtfulness.</p><p><b>Lars Muhl</b>&nbsp;is an internationally renowned author, speaker and healer.

By exploring and giving equal weight to transgendered subjectivities, however, Gayle Salamon upends these certainties. Considering questions of transgendered embodiment via phenomenology (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), psychoanalysis (Sigmund Freud and Paul Ferdinand Schilder), and queer theory, Salamon advances an alternative theory of normative and non-normative gender, proving the value and vitality of trans experience for thinking about embodiment.<br><br>Salamon suggests that the difference between transgendered and normatively gendered bodies is not, in the end, material. Rather, she argues that the production of gender itself relies on a disjunction between the "felt sense" of the body and an understanding of the body's corporeal contours, and that this process need not be viewed as pathological in nature. Examining the relationship between material and phantasmatic accounts of bodily being, Salamon emphasizes the productive tensions that make the body both present and absent in our consciousness and work to confirm and unsettle gendered certainties. She questions traditional theories that explain how the body comes to be&#x2014;and comes to be made one's own&#x2014;and she offers a new framework for thinking about what "counts" as a body. The result is a groundbreaking investigation into the phenomenological life of gender.</p><p>Gayle Salamon earned her Ph.D. from the Rhetoric Department at the University of California, Berkeley, and is assistant professor of English at Princeton University.Engaging with a broad range of audiences, Salamon makes a convincing case that the lens offered by transgendered embodiment and subjectivity reconfigures entrenched theoretical positions in gender studies, psychoanalysis, and continental philosophy. (Penelope Deutscher, Northwestern University)<br><br><i>Assuming a Body</i> makes a stunning intervention, by way of phenomenology, into contemporary theories of the body. Situating transgenderism within 'rhetorics of materiality,' Gayle Salamon crafts a supple theoretical framework capable of accounting for both the theory and the lived experience of alternative genders. This book will undoubtedly bridge the gap between transgender studies and critical theory, and, in the process, will open up new ways of understanding what it means to be embodied. (J. Halberstam, author of <i>Female Masculinity</i> and <i>In A Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives</i>)<br><br>The 'next big thing' for anyone interested in critically theorizing about contemporary transgender phenomena, <i>Assuming a Body</i> squarely addresses the debates and polemics thrown up during the field's fiery formative decade in the 1990s-the relationships between trans, queer, and feminist theories; performativity, discursivity, and materiality; and psychoanalysis and its discontents-and powerfully hits these balls back across the net. Salamon's next-generation (re)iteration of these intellectually vital arguments forges stronger connections between trans studies and current reappraisals of affective or phenomenological approaches to embodiment, as well as to the post-9/11 turn toward political economy and the critique of neoliberal governmentality. Scholars across a wide range of disciplines will be citing, siding with, and taking aim at this important book for years to come. (Susan Stryker, Indiana University)<br><br>For those who enjoy a challenge, this book rewards with its timely, thought-provoking examination of the body, and the intersection of transgender psychology and critical theory. (Rachel Pepper <i>Curve</i>)<br><br>Salomon's book achieves to be theoretically rigorous on issues of gender and embodiment and to acknowledge the specificity and reality of transgender experience in a way that challenges the reader to rethink conceptions of sex and gender at their cutting edge. (<i>Metapsychology</i>)<br><br>...this original contribution reconfigures old questions and issues and engages with new ones, ultimately inviting us all to reconsider what it means to be embodied. (<i>Somatechnics</i>)<br><br>...an important resource and instigation for future work along some very promising lines of thought. (Tamsin Lorraine <i>PhiloSOPHIA</i>)</p><h2>On Her Own Terms: Annie Montague Alexander and the Rise of Science in the American West</h2><p>At a time when women could not vote and very few were involved in the world outside the home, Annie Montague Alexander (1867-1950) was an intrepid explorer, amateur naturalist, skilled markswoman, philanthropist, farmer, and founder and patron of two natural history museums at the University of California, Berkeley. Barbara R. Stein presents a luminous portrait of this remarkable woman, a pioneer who helped shape the world of science in California, yet whose name has been little known until now.<br> Alexander's father founded a Hawaiian sugar empire, and his great wealth afforded his adventurous daughter the opportunity to pursue her many interests. Stein portrays Alexander as a complex, intelligent, woman who--despite her frail appearance--was determined to achieve something with her life. Along with Louise Kellogg, her partner of forty years, Alexander collected thousands of animal, plant, and fossil specimens throughout western North America. Their collections serve as an invaluable record of the flora and fauna that were beginning to disappear as the West succumbed to spiraling population growth, urbanization, and agricultural development. Today at least seventeen taxa are named for Alexander, and several others honor Kellogg, who continued to make field trips after Alexander's death.<br> Alexander's dealings with scientists and her encouragement--and funding--of women to do field research earned her much admiration, even from those with whom she clashed. Stein's extensive use of archival material, including excerpts from correspondence and diaries, allows us to see Annie Alexander as a keen observer of human nature who loved women and believed in their capabilities. Her legacy endures in the fields of zoology and paleontology and also in the lives of women who seek to follow their own star to the fullest degree possible.</p><p>"Make no mistake--this is not a book about a single subject. It is rather about a life of enormous breadth and substance, one engaging science, conservation, philanthropy, education, and women's rights. Annie Montague Alexander was extraordinary, and Barbara Stein has done her subject proud."--Alfred Runte, author of <i>Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness</i><br><br>"Based on Annie Montague Alexander's correspondence and diaries, Barbara Stein has created a vivid and at times intimate portrait of a woman scientist at the turn of the twentieth century. This is an epic story that resonates with our contemporary desire to illuminate women's lives, and with our efforts to understand and preserve the natural world of California and the West."--Ruth Sime, author of <i>Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics</i><br><br>"A thorough and insightful account of a remarkable individual who, as an important patron and an amateur contributor, influenced the course of early twentieth-century science. Alexander's life is also important simply as a human story of how an itelligent, active, and strong-minded woman coped with the problems of identity and work in the post-Victorian era. It's a great story of a complex and admirable woman, and a significant contribution to California history and the history of field science."--Robert E. Kohler, University of Pennsylvania<br><br>"A clear account of one of the most important contributions to the study of natural history on the west coast."--David Rains Wallace, author of <i>The Bonehunter's Revenge: Dinosaurs, Greed, and the Greatest Feud of the Gilded Age</i>&#34;A thorough and insightful account of a remarkable individual who, as an important patron and an amateur contributor, influenced the course of early twentieth-century science.

The Latin poet Statius reworks a familiar story from Greek myth, dramatized long before by Aeschylus in his tragedy <i>Seven against Thebes</i>. Statius chose his subject well: the Rome of his day, ruled by the emperor Domitian, was not too distant from the civil wars that had threatened the survival of the empire. Published in 92 A.D., the <i>Thebaid</i> was an immediate success, and its fame grew in succeeding centuries. It reached its peak of popularity in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, influencing Dante, Chaucer, and perhaps Shakespeare. In recent times, however, it has received perhaps less attention than it deserves, in large part because there has been no accessible, dynamic translation of the work into English.</p><p>Charles Stanley Ross offers a compelling version of the <i>Thebaid</i> rendered into forceful, modern English. Casting Statius's Latin hexameter into a lively iambic pentameter more natural to the modern ear, Ross frees the work from the archaic formality that has marred previous translations. His translation reinvigorates the <i>Thebaid</i> as a whole: its meditative first half and its violent second half; its intimate portrayal of defeat and retribution, and the need to seek justice at any cost. In a wide-ranging introduction, Ross provides an overview of the poem: its composition, reception and legacy; its major themes and literary influences; and its place in Statius' life. And in a helpful series of notes, he offers background information on the major characters and incidents.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Stanley Ross </b>is a professor of English and chair of the program in comparative literature at Purdue University.</p><p>"This translation is the product of an ear and pen attentive to Statius's nervous, hectic, indelibly intimate portrayal of human frustration, need for requital, and dependence on violence to right the wrongly tilted scales of justice. It is a percussive work and each stroke counts. In addition, Statius is the crucial presence in the <i>Purgatorio</i> of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Ross's translation will surely make Statius's presence there much more understandable to English-language readers. In sum, Ross has given us a truly viable, unforgettable <i>Thebaid</i>."</p> (Allen Mandelbaum, Wake Forest University)<br><br><p>"The fluency, clarity, and immediacy of this translation make it the best available choice for teachers who wish to introduce students to a great but often neglected poet."</p> (Neil Bernstein <i>Classical Outlook</i>)<br><br><p>"Readers of Ross' translation in American verse will enjoy the flow of his English."</p> (Paolo Asso <i>New England Classical Journal</i>)</p><h2>Now in November</h2><p>This unforgettable novel tells in shimmering language the story of a middle-class family driven into poverty by the Depression. Three daughters struggle to survive with their parents as farmers, battling against the elements and trying to come to terms with their harsh, unresponsive father.

Johnson belongs in the tradition of Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW It is a book that sings NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE Perhaps it is her obvious radical sympathies that have kept Johnson&#39;s novel of dustbowl and depression from being a key text of 20th-century American literature, or perhaps it is that after this Pulitzer Prize-winning debut, Johnson struggled to meet expectations and failed. When working on the novel, she was aware of &#39;the great flood of books already published&#39;, but was confident that her story of how the Wall Street Crash and drought affect one family needed to be told. Her young narrator picks the turning points in her family&#39;s misfortunes without over-labouring her portents. The dynamics between parents and daughters and the squabble between siblings are as carefully laid out as the ill omens, such as the shooting of a family dog. Johnson evokes the charms of a character poised on the brink of the adult world yet still bounded by childish concerns, and anchors her story firmly in a landscape that is equal to any of her characters GUARDIAN UNLIMITED There is a kinship between Katherine Mansfield and Josephine Johnson ELIZABETH HART</p><h2>The Mabinogion (Oxford World&#39;s Classics Hardback Collection)</h2><p><strong>Then they took the flowers of the oak, and the flowers of the broom, and the flowers of the meadowsweet, and from those they conjured up the fairest and most beautiful maiden that anyone had ever seen.</strong><br><br>Celtic mythology, Arthurian romance, and an intriguing interpretation of British history--these are just some of the themes embraced by the anonymous authors of the eleven tales that make up the Welsh medieval masterpiece known as the<em> Mabinogion</em>. They tell of Gwydion the shape-shifter, who can create a woman out of flowers; of Math the magician whose feet must lie in the lap of a virgin; of hanging a pregnant mouse and hunting a magical boar. Dragons, witches, and giants live alongside kings and heroes, and quests of honor, revenge, and love are set against the backdrop of a country struggling to retain its independence.<br><br>Sioned Davies' lively translation recreates the storytelling world of medieval Wales and re-invests the tales with the power of performance.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sioned Davies</strong> is Chair of Welsh at Cardiff University. Her special interest is the interplay between literacy and the oral tradition, together with the performance aspects of medieval Welsh narrative. Her publications include <em>Crefft y Cyfarwydd</em>, a study of narrative techniques in the <em>Mabinogion</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Four Branches of the Mabinogi</em>, and a co-edited volume, <em>The Horse in Celtic Culture: Medieval Welsh Perspectives</em>.<br>...a frsh translation which clears away archaisms and preconceptions to privilege the clear voice of story...[and] which is linguistically rigorous yet ever awake to the requirements of both text and reader. * Institute of Translation and Interpreting * It may be said at once that the translation will have instant success. It will bring the tales to thousands of new readers, while its commentary will be a vital tool for scholars....By fuelling debate on this and other questions, Sioned Davies&#39;s splendid volume inaugurates a new age of Mabinogion studies. * Modern Language Review * Davies&#39;s translation surpasses all its predecessors in accuracy and readability... [her] scholarly introduction is greatly superior to that of previous translators and can be recommended unreservedly. * Patrick Sims-Williams, TLS * An illuminating and relaxed translation...The Mabinogion are the cornerstone of medieval Welsh literature. They are gloriously inventive, highly dramatic, sometimes ferocious, sometimes lyrical, often witty, and ultimately profound in their understanding and revelation of human nature. In my estimate, Sioned Davies has done them and her modern readers proud. * Kevin Crossley-Holland, The Times (Books) * The Mabinogion is famously magical. Enchantment glows on every page, but it does not here violate the laws of nature: it reveals them. * Murrough O&#39;Brien, The Independent on Sunday * This fresh, energetic translation is a revelation and, for the first time, shows off The Mabinogion tales as what they were originally: splendid entertainment. * The Guardian Review * An accurate and very lively version of the tales: it sounds modern and reads well. * Gwyn Thomas, Cambria Magazine * Davies&#39;s prose is stark and fierce, the laconic dialogue spine-tingling, and she makes the page sing. * Marina Warner, The Independent *</p><h2>It&#39;s My Life Now: Starting Over After an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>Those who have never experienced an abusive or violent relationship often believe that upon finding a way out, victims&#x2019; difficulties are solved: their life is good, they are safe, and recovery will be swift. However, survivors know that leaving is not the end of the nightmare -- it is the beginning of an often difficult and challenging journey toward healing and happiness. <strong><em>It&#x2019;s My Life Now</em></strong> offers readers the practical guidance, emotional reassurance, and psychological awareness that survivors of relationship abuse and domestic violence need to heal and reclaim their lives after leaving their abusers. </p> <p>Since its publication in 2000, <strong><em>It's My Life Now</em></strong> has been highly successful as a working manual for survivors who are starting their lives over after an abusive relationship. This valuable book combines direction on practical and emotional issues with worksheets and self-exploration exercises. Now, in the second edition, Dugan and Hock include updated information and resources while encompassing a wider range of individuals and the relationships in which abuse and violence occur. The new edition also provides a new emphasis on safety assessment, which has increasingly been shown to be a critical factor in recovery. In addition, this new edition includes current resources and information about organizations for victims along with revised and enhanced strategies to help survivors move forward on the path of recovery.</p></p><p><strong>Meg Kennedy Dugan, M.A.</strong>, is Director of the AmeriCorps Victim Assistance Program, a program of the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence.

John has been setting the standard for high quality personal alternative health care in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1988. His practice ranges from individual healing sessions at his Sausalito office to on site Feng Shui design and consultation, to lectures delivered across the range of academic and social institutions from small rural classrooms to the United Nations. He travels worldwide giving workshops on the Aztec Sun Calendar and now on the Virgin of Guadalupe.<p> </p><p> John has studied the beliefs and sciences of indigenous cultures since he was very young. This led him to directly explore these cultures, and to go through many fascinating and unique experiences. Because of his alternative medical practice, he&#x2019;s had to go deeply into the academic study of a number of indigenous and modern sciences to discover how best to help his patients. This led him to write the book Day of Destiny, so he could help more people than was is able to in his daily practice. The ancient medical classics state, &#x201c;The superior physician treats the society as well as the patient.&#x201d; John lives by this motto. The Aztec Virgin represents the next step in the evolution of this philosophy. </p><p> In his introduction to The Aztec Virgin John writes: </p><p> &#x201c;October, 1988. It was there in the marketplace at Tepeyacac, in modern Mexico City Tenochtitlan, that I met the first representatives from a very special group of Aztec teachers. They took me on an incredible journey that went deep into the heart of their world. That adventure has never ended. A portion of what they taught me relates to the origins and divine intentions of the numinous being we know as the Virgin of Guadalupe and her relationship with the birth of the next Solar Age, the Sun of Flowers...&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Atoms and Eden: Conversations on Religion and Science</h2><p>Here is an unprecedented collection of twenty freewheeling and revealing interviews with major players in the ongoing--and increasingly heated--debate about the relationship between religion and science. These lively conversations cover the most important and interesting topics imaginable: the Big Bang, the origins of life, the nature of consciousness, the foundations of religion, the meaning of God, and much more. <br> In <em>Atoms and Eden</em>, Peabody Award-winning journalist Steve Paulson explores these topics with some of the most prominent public intellectuals of our time, including Richard Dawkins, Karen Armstrong, E. O. Wilson, Sam Harris, Elaine Pagels, Francis Collins, Daniel Dennett, Jane Goodall, Paul Davies, and Steven Weinberg. The interviewees include Christians, Buddhists, Jews, and Muslims, as well as agnostics, atheists, and other scholars who hold perspectives that are hard to categorize. Paulson's interviews sweep across a broad range of scientific disciplines--evolutionary biology, quantum physics, cosmology, and neuroscience--and also explore key issues in theology, religious history, and what William James called ''the varieties of religious experience.'' Collectively, these engaging dialogues cover the major issues that have often pitted science against religion--from the origins of the universe to debates about God, Darwin, the nature of reality, and the limits of human reason. These are complex, intellectually rich discussions, presented in an accessible and engaging manner. Most of these interviews were originally published as individual cover stories for <em>Salon.com</em>, where they generated a huge reader response. Public Radio's "To the Best of Our Knowledge" will present a major companion series on related topics this fall. <br> A feast of ideas and competing perspectives, this volume will appeal to scientists, spiritual seekers, and the intellectually curious.</p><p><br><strong>Steve Paulson</strong> is Executive Producer of Wisconsin Public Radio's nationally syndicated radio program "To the Best of Our Knowledge."

Using interviews with scientists, historians and philosophers as a springboard, Paulson deftly creates a conversation about faith, doubt and the very nature of belief systems that draws the reader into rethinking assumptions about what's important in the way we build our lives today." <br> <br>--Deborah Blum, author, <em>Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"These transcripts capture the excitement of the radio series from which they are drawn.

He has chosen Mails (The Pueblo Children of the Earth Mother, Doubleday, 1983) as his vehicle. The result is a polemic for the position of Hopi "traditionals" and against the "progressives" of the Hopi Tribal Council. This history of the Hopi people from their emergence into this world through 1994 concentrates on events subsequent to the infamous 1906 split at the village of Oraibi and the establishment of Hotevilla by the ousted traditionalists. While there are more even-handed discussions of these events (see Peter M. Whiteley's Deliberate Acts: Changing Hopi Culture Through the Oraibi Split, Univ. of Arizona, 1988), Mails does provide transcriptions of the hard-to-find Hotevilla newsletter, Techqua Ikachi (1975-86), which disseminated the traditionals' views to the world at large. Mails's books are known for their pen-and-ink drawings, but this one relies largely on poorly reproduced photographs. A disappointment.<br><i>Mary B.

Looking at both mass media and high art forms, she challenges the seeming transparency and apparent apolitical innocence of our visual images and verbal stories, asserting that these construct rather than reflect or express our experience of the world.</p><p>Linda Hutcheon is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto. She has published extensively on postmodernism, parody and irony (including <em>Irony's Edge: The Theory and Politics of Irony</em>) and has recently done interdisciplinary work with Michael Hutcheon on opera and medicine (<em>Opera: Desire, Disease and Death, and Bodily Charm: Living Opera</em>)."Intelligent and well-informed, Hutcheon's book (which also supplies the reader with a generous bibliography), in its reference to a multitude of verbal and visual texts as well as critical writings on the subject, is an excellent text for pedagogical purposes." -- <i>Novel</i></p>
